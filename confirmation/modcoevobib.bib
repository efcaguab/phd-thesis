  Abstract                 = {We present Procrustean Approach to Cophylogeny (PACo), a novel statistical tool to test for congruence between phylogenetic trees, or between phylogenetic distance matrices of associated taxa. Unlike previous tests, PACo evaluates the dependence of one phylogeny upon the other. This makes it especially appropriate to test the classical coevolutionary model that assumes that parasites that spend part of their life in or on their hosts track the phylogeny of their hosts. The new method does not require fully resolved phylogenies and allows for multiple host-parasite associations. PACo produces a Procrustes superimposition plot enabling a graphical assessment of the fit of the parasite phylogeny onto the host phylogeny and a goodness-of-fit statistic, whose significance is established by randomization of the host-parasite association data. The contribution of each individual host-parasite association to the global fit is measured by means of jackknife estimation of their respective squared residuals and confidence intervals associated to each host-parasite link. We carried out different simulations to evaluate the performance of PACo in terms of Type I and Type II errors with respect to two similar published tests. In most instances, PACo performed at least as well as the other tests and showed higher overall statistical power. In addition, the jackknife estimation of squared residuals enabled more elaborate validations about the nature of individual links than the ParaFitLink1 test of the program ParaFit. In order to demonstrate how it can be used in real biological situations, we applied PACo to two published studies using a script written in the public-domain statistical software R.},

Until very recently, the complexity of these networks precluded a community-wide approach to the investigation of mutualism. However, recent studies using tools and concepts from physics and sociology have allowed the exploration of this complexity within a rational framework. Regardless of differences across sites or species composition, networks of mutual benefit have a similar structure. Describing these network patterns is important for understanding both the generation of biodiversity and its responses to anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat loss and species extinctions. This network approach is currently being applied to restoration ecology, biological invasions, and the conservation of endangered species.},

  Abstract                 = {The mutually beneficial interactions between plants and their animal pollinators and seed dispersers have been paramount in the generation of Earth's biodiversity These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceeds in these highly diversified mutualisms among free-living species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., phenology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure has important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},

There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {Pollination network studies are based on pollinator surveys conducted on focal plants. This plant-centred approach provides insufficient information on flower visitation habits of rare pollinator species, which are the majority in pollinator communities. As a result, pollination networks contain very high proportions of pollinator species linked to a single plant species (extreme specialists), a pattern that contrasts with the widely accepted view that plant-pollinator interactions are mostly generalized. In this study of a Mediterranean scrubland community in NE Spain we supplement data from an intensive field survey with the analysis of pollen loads carried by pollinators. We observed 4265 contacts corresponding to 19 plant and 122 pollinator species. The addition of pollen data unveiled a very significant number of interactions, resulting in important network structural changes. Connectance increased 1.43-fold, mean plant connectivity went from 18.5 to 26.4, and mean pollinator connectivity from 2.9 to 4.1. Extreme specialist pollinator species decreased 0.6-fold, suggesting that ecological specialization is often overestimated in plant-pollinator networks. We expected a greater connectivity increase in rare species, and consequently a decrease in the level of asymmetric specialization. However, new links preferentially attached to already highly connected nodes and, as a result, both nestedness and centralization increased. The addition of pollen data revealed the existence of four clearly defined modules that were not apparent when only field survey data were used. Three of these modules had a strong phenological component. In comparison to other pollination webs, our network had a high proportion of connector links and species. That is, although significant, the four modules were far from isolated.},

  Abstract                 = {Interaction webs, or networks, define how the members of two or more trophic levels interact. However, the traits that mediate network structure have not been widely investigated. Generally, the mechanism that determines plant-pollinator partnerships is thought to involve the matching of a suite of species traits (such as abundance, phenology, morphology) between trophic levels. These traits are often unknown or hard to measure, but may reflect phylogenetic history. We asked whether morphological traits or phylogenetic history were more important in mediating network structure in mutualistic plant-pollinator interaction networks from Western Canada. At the plant species level, sexual system, growth form, and flower symmetry were the most important traits. For example species with radially symmetrical flowers had more connections within their modules (a subset of species that interact more among one another than outside of the module) than species with bilaterally symmetrical flowers. At the pollinator species level, social species had more connections within and among modules. In addition, larger pollinators tended to be more specialized. As traits mediate interactions and have a phylogenetic signal, we found that phylogenetically close species tend to interact with a similar set of species. At the network level, patterns were weak, but we found increasing functional trait and phylogenetic diversity of plants associated with increased weighted nestedness. These results provide evidence that both specific traits and phylogenetic history can contribute to the nature of mutualistic interactions within networks, but they explain less variation between networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Phylogenetic congruence is governed by various macroevolutionary events, including cospeciation, host switching, sorting, duplication, and failure to speciate. The relative frequency of these events may be influenced by factors that govern the distribution and abundance of the interacting groups; i.e., ecological factors. If so, it may be possible to predict the degree of phylogenetic congruence between two groups from information about their ecology. Unfortunately, adequate comparative ecological data are not available for many of the systems that have been subjected to cophylogenetic analysis. An exception is provided by chewing lice ( Insecta: Phthiraptera), which parasitize birds and mammals. For a few genera of these lice, enough data have now been published to begin exploring the relationship between ecology and congruence. In general, there is a correspondence between important ecological factors and the degree of phylogenetic congruence. Careful comparison of these genera suggests that dispersal is a more fundamental barrier to host switching among related hosts than is establishment. Transfer experiments show that host-specific lice can survive and reproduce on novel hosts that are similar in size to the native host as long as the lice can disperse to these hosts. To date, studies of parasite dispersal have been mainly inferential. A better understanding of the role of dispersal will require more direct data on dispersal frequency and distances.},

  Abstract                 = {P>1. Understanding the structure of ecological networks is a crucial task for interpreting community and ecosystem responses to global change. 2. Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant-animal mutualistic and host-parasite networks. 4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Within food webs, species can be partitioned into groups according to various criteria. Two notions have received particular attention: trophic groups (TGs), which have been used for decades in the ecological literature, and more recently, modules. The relationship between these two group concepts remains unknown in empirical food webs. While recent developments in network theory have led to efficient methods for detecting modules in food webs, the determination of TGs (groups of species that are functionally similar) is largely based on subjective expert knowledge. We develop a novel algorithm for TG detection. We apply this method to empirical food webs and show that aggregation into TGs allows for the simplification of food webs while preserving their information content. Furthermore, we reveal a two-level hierarchical structure where modules partition food webs into large bottom-top trophic pathways, whereas TGs further partition these pathways into groups of species with similar trophic connections. This provides new perspectives for the study of dynamical and functional consequences of food-web structure, bridging topological and dynamical analysis. TGs have a clear ecological meaning and are found to provide a trade-off between network complexity and information loss.},

  Abstract                 = {Competitor species can have evolutionary effects on each other that result in ecological character displacement; that is, divergence in resource-exploiting traits such as jaws and beaks. Nevertheless, the process of character displacement occurring in nature, from the initial encounter of competitors to the evolutionary change in one or more of them, has not previously been investigated. Here we report that a Darwin's finch species (Geospiza fortis) on an undisturbed Galapagos island diverged in beak size from a competitor species ( G. magnirostris) 22 years after the competitor's arrival, when they jointly and severely depleted the food supply. The observed evolutionary response to natural selection was the strongest recorded in 33 years of study, and close to the value predicted from the high heritability of beak size. These findings support the role of competition in models of community assembly, speciation, and adaptive radiations.},

  Abstract                 = {A major current challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand how networks of interacting species shape the coevolutionary process. We combined a model for trait evolution with data for twenty plant-animal assemblages to explore coevolution in mutualistic networks. The results revealed three fundamental aspects of coevolution in species-rich mutualisms. First, coevolution shapes species traits throughout mutualistic networks by speeding up the overall rate of evolution. Second, coevolution results in higher trait complementarity in interacting partners and trait convergence in species in the same trophic level. Third, convergence is higher in the presence of super-generalists, which are species that interact with multiple groups of species. We predict that worldwide shifts in the occurrence of super-generalists will alter how coevolution shapes webs of interacting species. Introduced species such as honeybees will favour trait convergence in invaded communities, whereas the loss of large frugivores will lead to increased trait dissimilarity in tropical ecosystems.},

Here, we propose a method that allows one to systematically extract and display information contained in complex networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that one can (i) find modules in complex networks and (ii) classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of within- and between-module connections. The method thus yields a `cartographic representation' of complex networks.},

Directed unipartite networks only have one type of node, but links have an origin and an end. We show that directed unipartite networks can be conveniently represented as bipartite networks for module identification purposes.

We report here a test of this prediction which involves the construction of phylogenetic trees for rodents and their ectoparasites using protein electrophoretic data. We find a high degree of concordance in the branching patterns of the trees which suggests that there is a history of cospeciation in this host–parasite assemblage. In several cases where the branching patterns were identical in the host and parasite phylogenies, the branch lengths were also very similar which, given the assumptions of molecular clock theory, strongly suggests that the speciation of these hosts and ectoparasites was roughly contemporaneous and causally related.},

  Abstract                 = {(1) Pollination relationships were investigated for fourteen months in a southern Spanish Mediterranean coastal scrub community, composed of thirty plant species, at Reserva Biologica de Donana, Donana National Park. (2) Flowering encompassed the whole year, as did insect visits to flowers. Distinct seasonal changes, however, in both the number and identity of insect taxa, and in the number of plant species in bloom were apparent: maximum plant and insect richness occurred in spring. (3) Insect visitors mainly included small beetles, honeybees, small halictid bees, syrphids and bombylids. The overall species richness of the pollinator array was very high (187 taxa). (4) Plant species with specialized pollination mechanisms were relatively infrequent. Most plants had non-restrictive or small flowers, or both. Species relying on pollen to attract pollinators outweighed those relying on nectar as the main reward. (5) Joint analysis of flower attributes, blooming phenology and pollination vectors demonstrated that species flowering at about the same time of year tend to have their flowers visited by the same insects, irrespective of floral features. (6) It is hypothesized that fruit set is more resource- than pollen-limited and that to achieve maximum fruit set most plants have unspecialized pollination relationships. The generalized nature of pollination systems may have been a major factor contributing to the survival and weedy behaviour of many Mediterranean scrub species.},

  Abstract                 = {665 measurements of nectar concentration and 983 of nectar volume per day, distributed among 37 out of 43 species of flowering plants examined, are recorded and analysed. Nectar production per unit area per season was substantially less at Lake Hazen, 82Â° N, than at Churchill, 58Â°N. Nectar yield in mg sugar/flower/day was higher at Lake Hazen than at Churchill in eight of the ten species for which data were obtained at both localities. There is competition between flowers for pollinators rather than among pollinators for nectar. Heliotropic flowers, notably Dryas and Papaver, focus sunlight falling on them in the region of the germ cells; it is shown that the thermal increments obtainable by black insects resting in these flowers can be important. 184 different plant species - insect species associations are reported, based on about 350 observations and 760 insect specimens; these associations fall into 9 activity categories (some into more than one), as follows: ambush (6), basking (4), flying over (20), hidden in (20), courtship behaviour (1), nectar feeding (23), ovipositing (2), pollen feeding or collecting (12), resting on or uncertain (96). It is concluded that flowers and floral groups are important as aggregation centres for insect populations in this environment. /// ÐÐ° 37 Ð¸Ð· 43 Ð²Ð¸Ð´Ð¾Ð² ÑÐ²ÐµÑÑÑÐ¸Ñ ÑÐ°ÑÑÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð¹ Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ð»Ð¸ Ð¾Ð¿ÑÐµÐ´ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ ÐºÐ¾Ð½ÑÐµÐ½ÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð¸ Ð¸ Ð¾Ð±"ÐµÐ¼Ð° Ð½ÐµÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ° Ð² ÑÐ²ÐµÑÐºÐ°Ñ (665 Ð¾Ð¿ÑÐµÐ´ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð¹ ÐºÐ¾Ð½ÑÐµÐ½ÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð¸ Ð½ÐµÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ° Ð¸ 983 Ð¾Ð¿ÑÐµÐ´ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ Ð¾Ð±"ÐµÐ¼Ð° Ð½ÐµÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ°).

  Abstract                 = {Across different taxa, networks of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions show consistent architecture. Most networks are modular, with modules being distinct species subsets connected mainly with each other and having few connections to other modules. We investigate the phylogenetic relatedness of species within modules and whether a phylogenetic signal is detectable in the within- and among-module connectivity of species using 27 mammal-flea networks from the Palaearctic. In the 24 networks that were modular, closely related hosts co-occurred in the same module more often than expected by chance; in contrast, this was rarely the case for parasites. The within- and among-module connectivity of the same host or parasite species varied geographically. However, among-module but not within- module connectivity of host and parasites was somewhat phylogenetically constrained. These findings suggest that the establishment of host-parasite networks results from the interplay between phylogenetic influences acting mostly on hosts and local factors acting on parasites, to create an asymmetrically constrained pattern of geographic variation in modular structure. Modularity in host-parasite networks seems to result from the shared evolutionary history of hosts and by trait convergence among unrelated parasites. This suggests profound differences between hosts and parasites in the establishment and functioning of bipartite antagonistic networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Like altruism, mutualism, cooperation between species, evolves only by enhancing all participants' inclusive fitness. Mutualism evolves most readily between members of different kingdoms, which pool complementary abilities for mutual benefit: some of these mutualisms represent major evolutionary innovations. Mutualism cannot persist if cheating annihilates its benefits. In long-term mutualisms, symbioses, at least one party associates with the other nearly all its life. Usually, a larger host harbours smaller symbionts. Cheating is restrained by vertical transmission, as in Buchnera; partner fidelity, as among bull-thorn acacias and protective ants; test-based choice of symbionts, as bobtail squid choose bioluminescent bacteria; or sanctioning nonperforming symbionts, as legumes punish nonperforming nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Mutualisms involving brief exchanges, as among plants and seed-dispersers, however, persist despite abundant cheating. Both symbioses and brief-exchange mutualisms have transformed whole ecosystems. These mutualisms may be steps towards ecosystems which, like Adam Smith's ideal economy, serve their members' common good.},

We tested this proposition by examining the evolutionary radiation of Anolis lizards on the four islands of the Greater Antilles. Morphometric analyses indicate that the same set of habitat specialists, termed ecomorphs, occurs on all four islands. Although these similar assemblages could result from a single evolutionary origin of each ecomorph, followed by dispersal or vicariance, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the ecomorphs originated independently on each island. Thus, adaptive radiation in similar environments can overcome historical contingencies to produce strikingly similar evolutionary outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {A pollination network of 26 pollinator species interacting with 17 plant species from the small Greenlandic island Uummannaq was analyzed for multiple parameters values. Of the insects collected, 77% of all individuals and 77% of all species belonged to Diptera. The ratio of pollinators to plant species was 1.5, which is lower than in other Arctic pollination networks. This might be a double-island effect as Uummannaq is a small island next to Greenland. Connectance was 14.3%, and linkage level of pollinator and plant species averaged 2.4 and 3.7 species links, respectively. The characteristic path length and average clustering coefficient of the 1-mode networks were 1.4 and 0.83, respectively, for the pollinator species and 1.3 and 0.79, respectively, for the plant species. For both pollinator species and plant species, the tail of the degree distribution had the best fit to an exponential model, indicating that the most connected species was constrained in their linking. However, the extremely short path length and high clustering indicated that the networks had small-world behavior, meaning that any disturbance is spread very fast to the entire network and that the networks are error tolerant but vulnerable to attack on the most linked species.},

  Abstract                 = {The assemblages of visitors to angiosperms flowering at a montane and at a high alpine site in the Andes of Mendoza, Argentina (33-34Â°S) were described and the plant-flower visitor matrices were analyzed and compared to other systems, in particular those located at a similar latitude on the western slope of the Andes. In the low-altitude (montane) habitat, 23 plant species had a total of 126 interactions with 71 taxa of insects and one hummingbird, and at the higher site 21 plants and 45 insect species had 83 interactions. Connectances of the visitor matrices were 7.6 and 8.7, respectively. Diptera and Hymenoptera dominated the visitor assemblages at both sites without change of proportions with altitude, while Lepidoptera significantly increased at the higher site. Flies were more species-rich than expected at the sites' latitude and more constant across altitudes than is usually observed. Lack of a significant decrease with altitude of (1) the frequency of Hymenoptera and (2) the number of interactions per plant were the main differences with a comparable gradient in the Chilean Andes. The proportion of self-compatible species increased with altitude; however, use of phylogenetically-independent contrasts showed that the prevalence of selfers at higher altitudes does not reflect a generalized reaction pattern but results from two speciose families (Asteraceae and Fabaceae) showing more self-compatibility at high altitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {I studied the spring wildflower community of mesic deciduous forests in piedmont North Carolina to determine (a) the extent to which fecundity is pollination-limited in the community, (b) the importance of competition for pollination in affecting seed-set, and (c) the characteristics of plants and their floral visitors that most contribute to full pollination. Although inadequate pollination seems likely in the community, supplemental hand-pollination significantly improved fecundity in just 3 of the 12 species I examined. Pollination-limited reproductive success was evident only in a distinctive subset of the community, species pollinated primarily by queen bumble bees. The majority of wildflower species are pollinated by flies and solitary bees. Measurements of visitation rates and pollinator effectiveness on these plants confirmed that they are usually adequately pollinated in spite of a short blooming season, considerable overlap in flowering times, extensive pollinator sharing by concurrently blooming species, and inclement weather that frequently interrupts insect activity. Many of the flies and solitary bees are inconstant foragers, yet competition for pollination among wildflower species through differential pollinator attraction or interspecific pollinator movements usually does not significantly decrease the seed-set of plants with shared visitors. Competition may act with other causes of insufficient pollination, however, as a selective force to maintain a characteristic set of floral biology traits within the community, including autogamy and self-compatibility, extended receptivity, and pollination by a variety of visitor types. That these floral traits contribute significantly to the successful pollination of vernal herbs was demonstrated by observations of visitor behavior, plant caging experiments that excluded visitors or restricted their access to selected flowers, and measurements of floral lifetimes and seed-set for individual plants. These traits are effective regardless of the source of pollination-limited fecundity, and it is the prevalence of such traits, rather than floral specialization or character displacement, that distinguishes the forest spring wildflower community from other communities with potentially inadequate pollinator service.},

  Abstract                 = {in natural communities, species and their interactions are often organized as nonrandom networks, showing distinct and repeated complex patterns. A prevalent, but poorly explored pattern is ecological modularity, with weakly interlinked subsets of species (modules), which, however, internally consist of strongly connected species. The importance of modularity has been discussed for a long time, but no consensus on its prevalence in ecological networks has yet been reached. Progress is hampered by inadequate methods and a lack of large datasets. We analyzed 51 pollination networks including almost 10,000 species and 20,000 links and tested for modularity by using a recently developed simulated annealing algorithm. All networks with >150 plant and pollinator species were modular, whereas networks with <50 species were never modular. Both module number and size increased with species number. Each module includes one or a few species groups with convergent trait sets that may be considered as coevolutionary units. Species played different roles with respect to modularity. However, only 15\% of all species were structurally important to their network. They were either hubs (i.e., highly linked species within their own module), connectors linking different modules, or both. If these key species go extinct, modules and networks may break apart and initiate cascades of extinction. Thus, species serving as hubs and connectors should receive high conservation priorities.},

  Abstract                 = {The KwaZuluâNatal region of South Africa hosts a large diversity of asclepiads (Apocynaceae: Asclepiadoideae), many of which are endemic to the area. The asclepiads are of particular interest because of their characteristically highly evolved floral morphology. During 3 months of fieldwork (November 2000 to January 2001) the flower visitors and pollinators to an assemblage of nine asclepiads at an upland grassland site were studied. These observations were augmented by laboratory studies of flower morphology (including scanning electron microscopy) and flower colour (using a spectrometer). Two of the specialized pollination systems that were documented are new to the asclepiads: fruit chafer pollination and pompilid wasp pollination. The latter is almost unique in the angiosperms. Taxa possessing these specific pollination systems cluster together in multidimensional phenotype space, suggesting that there has been convergent evolution in response to similar selection to attract identical pollinators. Pollination niche breadth varied from the very specialized species, with only one pollinator, to the more generalized, with up to ten pollinators. Pollinator sharing by the specialized taxa does not appear to have resulted in niche differentiation in terms of the temporal or spatial dimensions, or with regards to placement of pollinaria. Nestedness analysis of the data set showed that there was predictability and structure to the pattern of plantâpollinator interactions, with generalist insects visiting specialized plants and vice versa. The research has shown that there is still much to be learned about plantâpollinator interactions in areas of high plant diversity such as South Africa.},

  Abstract                 = {Species flowering during the dry season (late December to early April) form three main pollinator groups, namely, butterfly, solitary bee, and hummingbird flowers. The animal vectors present match these three flower syndromes. The daily and seasonal rhythms of flower opening and pollination activity are synchronized. Butterflies and solitary bees, active chiefly in the morning, visit flowers blooming only half a day. The number of seeds per fruit and the pollen-carrying capacity of the pollen vector are correlated. Butterflies, carrying few pollen grains, chiefly pollinate flowers with one to four seeds. Solitary bees, carrying many grains, chiefly pollinate flowers with many seeds per flower. These close links between the flowers and their visitors result in a high degree of successful pollination and a high percentage fruit set. A group of species, attracting no visitors, was characterized by a very narrow 'pollination gap,' making self-pollination almost inevitable. Heavy fruiting indicated self-fertility. Heterocorollary in Cordia sebestena, a double keel in Stylosanthes hamata, and several examples of andromonoecy are recorded for the first time. The presence of the adventive honeybee, Apis mellifera, in the association appeared detrimental to the native pollinators when forage was scarce. The whole scrub association appears balanced with a distinctive pattern of floral ecology. This circumstance, in terms of pollinators, is designated a Butterfly-Solitary bee-Hummingbird association.},

  Abstract                 = {The pollination ecology of tropical shrubland was studied in the Venezuelan Guayana Highlands. Most flowers are white or pink. Flower length is less than 0.5 cm for 45.4 percent of plant species (N = 55). The diameter has a similar distribution. Of the 62 visiting agents recorded on 55 plant species, 80.6 percent are pollinators and 19 4 percent are visitors only. Four families of bees are represented. Pollen is normally carried on only one location, frequently ventral, although it can also be carried on the head or legs. Pollen transportation by wasps (four families) is frequently ventral on the body and legs. Lepidopterans (three families) carry pollen grains on their proboscis. Coleopterans are represented by two species of Scarabaeidae which transport pollen ventrally. They as well as the dipterans visit only one plant species. Three bird species visit plant species in the shrubland. Politmus milleri (Trochilidae) pollinates seven plant species and the pollen is transported on the beak and head feathers.},

  Abstract                 = {A long-standing question in community ecology is whether food webs are organized in compartments, where species within the same compartment interact frequently among themselves, but show fewer interactions with species from other compartments. Finding evidence for this community organization is important since compartmentalization may strongly affect food web robustness to perturbation. However, few studies have found unequivocal evidence of compartments, and none has quantified the suite of mechanisms generating such a structure. Here, we combine computational tools from the physics of complex networks with phylogenetic statistical methods to show that a large marine food web is organized in compartments, and that body size, phylogeny, and spatial structure are jointly associated with such a compartmentalized structure. Sharks account for the majority of predatory interactions within their compartments. Phylogenetically closely related shark species tend to occupy different compartments and have divergent trophic levels, suggesting that competition may play an important role structuring some of these compartments. Current overfishing of sharks has the potential to change the structural properties, which might eventually affect the stability of the food web.},

  Abstract                 = {The interactions between plants and their animal pollinators and seed dispersers have moulded much of Earth's biodiversity(1-3). Recently, it has been shown that these mutually beneficial interactions form complex networks with a well-defined architecture that may contribute to biodiversity persistence(4-8). Little is known, however, about which ecological and evolutionary processes generate these network patterns(3,9). Here we use phylogenetic methods(10,11) to show that the phylogenetic relationships of species predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. As a consequence of the phylogenetic effects on interaction patterns, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree(12,13) and a more pronounced loss of taxonomic diversity than expected in the absence of a phylogenetic signal. Our results emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of phylogenetic information and network architecture can contribute to our understanding of the structure and fate of species-rich communities.},

  Abstract                 = {The systematic relationships of intracellular bacteria of 13 Camponotus species (carpenter ants) from America and Europe were compared to those of their hosts. Phylogenetic trees of the bacteria and the ants were based on 16S rDNA (rrs) gene sequences and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences, respectively. The bacterial endosymbionts of Camponotus spp, form a distinct lineage in the gamma-subclass of the Proteobacteria. The taxa most closely related to these bacteria are endosymbionts of aphids and the tsetse fly. The bacterial and host phylogenies deduced from the sequence data show a high degree of congruence, providing significant evidence for cospeciation of the bacteria and the ants and a maternal transmission route of the symbionts. The cloned rrs genes of the endosymbionts contain putative intervening sequences (IVSs) with a much lower G+C content than the mean of the respective rrs genes. By in situ hybridization specific 16S rDNA oligonucleotide probes verified the presence of the bacteria within tissues of three of the eukaryotic hosts. It is proposed that the endosymbionts of these three carpenter ants be assigned to a new taxon `Candidatus Blochmannia gen, nov.' with the symbionts of the individual ants being species named according to their host,'Candidatus Blochmannia floridanus sp. nov.', `Candidatus Blochmannia herculeanus sp. nov.' and `Candidatus Blochmannia rufipes sp. nov.}

  Abstract                 = {Fecundity characteristics, phenology, and behavior of insect flower-visitors were studied for 7 early flowering woodland herbs: Claytonia virginica, Dentaria laciniata, Dicentra canadensis, Dicentra cucullaria, Erythronium albidum, Isopyrum biternatum, and Sanguinaria canadensis. Sanguinaria canadensis is facultatively autogamous, the Dicentras are obligate outcrossers, and the remainder are self-compatible, at least within a stem. All are insect pollinated except sometimes S. canadensis. The numbers of ovules per flower and flowers per stem tended to be inversely correlated, and large-seeded species (S. canadensis, E. albidum, I. biternatum) had lower numbers of potential seeds per stem than did small-seeded species. Flowering of all species typically occurred during the first prolonged period of weather suitable for pollinator activity and ceased by the time the canopy closed. Annual differences in flowering times were associated with differences in average temperatures (i.e., early blooming in a warm, early spring), but cumulative degree-hours or degree-days of air or soil temperatures were not well correlated with flowering times. Other constraints on flowering phenology are discussed, including the predictability of suitable conditions, a proposed "fail-safe" mechanism that may assure flowering before canopy closure even if temperatures are abnomally low, and the importance of nontemperature factors in defining suitable conditions. Flowering time was not very finely tuned to the temperature regime and pollinator activity; flowers blooming during the flowering peak often had low seed production and the fertilization rate of most species was low. Evidence that seed production may have been pollinator limited for several species was obtained by comparing the success of hand pollination and of natural pollination, rarity of certain specialized pollinators, and estimates of the abortion rates of fertilized ovules. We suggest that flowering in early spring is a high-risk option in terms of insect-mediated sexual reproduction. Certain flower-visiting insects favored D. laciniata out of proportion to its abundance, but no effect on seed set of other species was detectable. Honeybees were abundant and active flower visitors with the potential for disrupting ecological/evolutionary relationships between native insects and flowers.},

  Abstract                 = {Phylogenetic diversity (PD) describes the total amount of phylogenetic distance among species in a community. Although there has been substantial research on the factors that determine community PD, exploration of the consequences of PD for ecosystem functioning is just beginning. We argue that PD may be useful in predicting ecosystem functions in a range of communities, from single-trophic to complex networks. Many traits show a phylogenetic signal, suggesting that PD can estimate the functional trait space of a community, and thus ecosystem functioning. Phylogeny also determines interactions among species, and so could help predict how extinctions cascade through ecological networks and thus impact ecosystem functions. Although the initial evidence available suggests patterns consistent with these predictions, we caution that the utility of PD depends critically on the strength of phylogenetic signals to both traits and interactions. We advocate for a synthetic approach that incorporates a deeper understanding of how traits and interactions are shaped by evolution, and outline key areas for future research. If these complexities can be incorporated into future studies, relationships between PD and ecosystem function bear promise in conceptually unifying evolutionary biology with ecosystem ecology.},

  Abstract                 = {It has recently been noted that empirical food webs are significantly compartmentalized; that is, subsets of species exist that interact more frequently among themselves than with other species in the community. Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Coevolution-reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species-is one of the central biological processes organizing the web of life, and most species are involved in one or more coevolved interactions. We have learned in recent years that coevolution is a highly dynamic process that continually reshapes interactions among species across ecosystems, creating geographic mosaics over timescales sometimes as short as thousands or even hundreds of years. If we take that as our starting point, what should we now be asking about the coevolutionary process? Here I suggest five major questions that we need to answer if we are to understand how coevolution shapes the web of life. How evolutionarily dynamic is specialization to other species, and what is the role of coevolutionary alternation in driving those dynamics? Does the geographic mosaic of coevolution shape adaptation in fundamentally different ways in different forms of interaction? How does the geographic mosaic of coevolution shape speciation? How does the structure of reciprocal selection change during the assembly of large webs of interacting species? How important are genomic events such as whole-genome duplication (i.e., polyploidy) and whole-genome capture (i.e., hybridization) in generating novel webs of interacting species? I end by suggesting four points about coevolution that we should tell every new student or researcher in biology.},
