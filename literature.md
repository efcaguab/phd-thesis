* Successful invasive species tend to be super-generalists [@Richardson2000; @Vila2009]
    - Non suitable pollinators limit the spread of alien species, those that can have pollinators are more likely to necome invasive [suggested by @Richardson2000]

* Invaders use efficiently available pollinators [@Richardson2000]

* Invasive plants affect the others trough two mechanisms [@Bjerknes2007]:
    - Effects on pollinator populations
    - Effects on pollinator behaviour

* There is evidence that native plants that have similar traits (morphological at least) to invaders might have a receive less visits than before [@Morales2009], there is also evidence that they dont [@Vila2009]

* Invaded communities receiver more pollination visits in total[@Vila2009]

* Invasive species don't induce overall changes in network structure (connectance, plant linkage level, and nestedness) [@Vila2009]

* Suggesting evidence that the impact of invading plants might be less worse than invading pollinators [@Vila2009] or complexes of invasive species when an invader facilitates further invaders; explained by @Simberloff2006 and proposed by @Simberloff1999

* Population dynamic models of mutualism there is an explosion of positive feedback and runaway in the populations [@May1982], that is related to invasion meldown [@Simberloff1999]

* Invasion meltdown [@Simberloff2006]. Mutualistic invasive species enter an "autocatalytic" process, and accelerate their spread and impact on the ecosystem., an invasive seed disperser ant facilitates the recruitment of an invasive plant that interacts strongly with it [@Prior2014]  

* A reason for a pollen pool: Visitation frequency is a surrogate of total interaction effect [@Vazquez2005], but that only takes into account immediate consequences of pollen deposition or seeds removal, not take into account fraction of outcrossed pollen or germination rate/defecated seeds. Relationship between visitation and effect is not linear. eg. infinite visitation doesn't lead to infinite benefit (saturation of polen). It can be bellshaped.

* Studies that explored the effects of invasions on network "stability" (in the broad sense): @Olesen2002, @Aizen2008, @Bartomeus2008, @Vila2009
