* Successful invasive species tend to be super-generalists [@Richardson2000; @Vila2009]

* Invaders use efficiently available pollinators [@Richardson2000]

* There is evidence that native plants that have similar traits (morphological at least) to invaders might have a receive less visits than before [@Morales2009], there is also evidence that they dont [@Vila2009]

* Invaded communities receiver more pollination visits in total[@Vila2009]

* Invasive species don't induce overall changes in network structure (connectance, plant linkage level, and nestedness) [@Vila2009]

* Suggesting evidence that the impact of invading plants might be less worse than invading pollinators [@Vila2009] or complexes of invasive species when an invader facilitates further invaders[explained by @Simberloff2006, proposed by @Simberloff1999]

* Population dynamic models of mutualism there is an explosion of positive feedback and runaway in the populations [@May1982], that is related to invasion meldown [@Simberloff1999]

* Invasion meltdown [@Simberloff2006]. Mutualistic invasive species enter an "autocatalytic" process, and accelerate their spread and impact on the ecosystem., an invasive seed disperser ant facilitates the recruitment of an invasive plant that interacts strongly with it [@Prior2014]  

* Studies that explored the effects of invasions on network "stability" (in the broad sense): @Olesen2002, @Aizen2008, @Bartomeus2008, @Vila2009
