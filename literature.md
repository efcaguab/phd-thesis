## Mutualism & general facts

* Obligate mutualisms are more common in the trophics, facultative mutualisms are more common in the temprate areas. That doesn't mean they are less important. Just more flexible. Reasons might be related to costly phenology during winter for example [@May1982]

* Population dynamic models of mutualism there is an explosion of positive feedback and runaway in the populations [@May1982], that is related to invasion meldown [@Simberloff1999]

## Invasive species & mutualisms

* Successful invasive species tend to be super-generalists [@Richardson2000; @Vila2009]
    - Non suitable pollinators limit the spread of alien species, those that can have pollinators are more likely to necome invasive [suggested by @Richardson2000]
    - Often alien species require efficient symbionts (pollinators, seed dispersers, mycorrhiza) to become invasive [@Richardson2000]

* From the competitive point of view more diverse communities should be less prone to invasion, from the mutalistic more diverse facilitates invasion. More diverse native can have more diverse invasive species [@Richardson2000]

* Invaders use efficiently available pollinators [@Richardson2000]

* Invasive plants affect the others trough two mechanisms [@Bjerknes2007]:
    - Effects on pollinator populations: Positive for example by supporting pollinators with more resources, especially in different times as the natives. Neggative as for example being toxic for pollinator larvae
    - Effects on pollinator behaviour:

* There is evidence that native plants that have similar traits (morphological at least) to invaders might have a receive less visits than before [@Morales2009], there is also evidence that they dont [@Vila2009]

* Invaded communities receiver more pollination visits in total[@Vila2009]

* Invasive species don't induce overall changes in network structure (connectance, plant linkage level, and nestedness) [@Vila2009], but that might depend on the degree of invasion [@Aizen2008]

* @Aizen2008 found that although total connenctance is maintained, links get transfered between native generalists to invasive generalists, an increasse in connectance in invasors and a decreasse in natives

* Highly invaded networks exhibit weaker mutualism (i.e. less reciprocal interdependence) that less invaded webs [@Aizen2008]

* Suggesting evidence that the impact of invading plants might be less worse than invading pollinators [@Vila2009] or complexes of invasive species when an invader facilitates further invaders; explained by @Simberloff2006 and proposed by @Simberloff1999

* Invasion meltdown [@Simberloff2006]. Mutualistic invasive species enter an "autocatalytic" process, and accelerate their spread and impact on the ecosystem., an invasive seed disperser ant facilitates the recruitment of an invasive plant that interacts strongly with it [@Prior2014]; *Ficus* only became invasive in Florida and New Zealand after the introduction of their specific plant pollinator [@Richardson2000]

* However @Olesen2002 didn't found invader complexes to be pervasive in oceanic islands. Instead, invaders get successfully assimilated by native super generalists

* A reason for a pollen pool: Visitation frequency is a surrogate of total interaction effect [@Vazquez2005], but that only takes into account immediate consequences of pollen deposition or seeds removal, not take into account fraction of outcrossed pollen or germination rate/defecated seeds. Relationship between visitation and effect is not linear. eg. infinite visitation doesn't lead to infinite benefit (saturation of polen). It can be bellshaped.

* Studies that explored the effects of invasions on network "stability" (in the broad sense): @Olesen2002, @Aizen2008, @Bartomeus2008, @Vila2009
