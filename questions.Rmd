### The evolution of modularity

To which degree modules are a byproduct of evolutionary dynamics and a byproduct of ecology. Are modules a byproduct of generalists/specialist dynamics at broader taxonomical scales [@Espinosa-Soto2010d]? Or the product of specialisation that resulysin reduced comperition with other exploiters -- a reduction of niche overlap -- [@Poissot2013c]

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
