#### Coevolution in multidimensional trait space favours escape from parasites and pathogens
[@Gilman2012]

* By using multiple traits at a time that the parasites/pathogens must overcome, host might catch up in the evolutionary race.
* The more traits are involved in the interaction, the smaller the interaction probability.
* Interaction probability depends on one or several traits in the host that are matched or surpassed by the parasite
    - Difference trait case
    - Matching trait case
* An escape function was defined based the trait difference and some scaling factor that represents the **effect of one interaction on the relative fitness of a victim or an exploiter**.
- Providing both an analytic and an quantitative model is a good way to get high impact

##### The way forward:
* Build a network basing the interactions on traits
* Explore how traits influence coevolution ina mutualistic network
* What is the effect of traits on species/populations and in the network as a whole?
