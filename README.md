# Doctoral thesis: the resilience of ecological networks

**Fernando Cagua** - *School of Biological Sciences, University of Canterbury*

Expected submission: December 2019

#### Summary

Natural ecosystems provide important services—like food and water—we humans depend on to a large extent. 
Much like the failure of a single key financial institution can trigger unexpected crashes on the stock market, human pressures—such as biological invasions and species extinctions—can cause sudden collapses that severely transform the way ecosystems function. 
However, despite its importance, we do not completely understand the dynamics that make ecosystems resilient to collapse. 
Because the functioning of ecosystems is largely determined by the network of interactions between the species that inhabit them, my research aims to quantify the role played by species interactions in determining the resilience of ecosystems. 
To achieve this, I focus on networks of mutually beneficial interactions, like those between plants and their pollinators, and use a combination of empirical data, computer simulations and ecological theory. 
Ultimately I want to understand why, when and how ecosystem collapses occur, and how to recover from them.

* The [latest version of my thesis](https://github.com/efcaguab/phd-thesis/releases/download/v1.0.2-thesis/thesis.pdf).

## Reproducibility

I used LaTeX and RMarkdown to typeset all documents and figures. 
You can find a `Makefile` in each subdirectory and a [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/efcaguab/phd-thesis/blob/master/thesis/Dockerfile) encapsulating all software requirements can be used to generate the thesis document.
