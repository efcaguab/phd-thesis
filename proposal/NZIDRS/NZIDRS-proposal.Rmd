From food and fresh water production, to recreation and carbon sequestration, ecosystems provide a wide range of services we value. When ecosystems transform, their ability to provide those services we depend on is undermined. 
The frequency of undesired ecosystem transformations---like the (often sudden) shift from a transparent to a turbid lake or from a self-sustaining fishery to a collapsed one---is dramatically increasing[@Scheffer2001a]. 
A necessary step to anticipate, prevent and reverse those unwanted transformations, is to understand the processes that support or undermine ecosystem resilience [@Hughes2005; @Tylianakis2008]. 

Resilience is the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without tipping into a regime shift---a large, persistent transformation in its functioning and structure [@Holling1973; @Gunderson2000]. 
Ecosystem functioning, structure, and ultimately its response to disturbances is largely determined by the network of interactions formed by species in an ecological community [@Bascompte2006; @Dobson2006; @Tylianakis2008; @Reiss2009]. 
**Therefore, the overall objective of my proposed research is to quantify the role played by species interactions in modulating ecosystem resilience**.  

Because of its importance for food production and the maintenance of global biodiversity [@Bascompte2006; @Bascompte2007; @Klein2007], I will focus on the network of mutualistic interactions between plants and pollinators. 
Biotic invasions are a significant component of human-caused global change [@Vitousek1997]
The first objective of my research is to determine how the properties of the networks determine the susceptibility of an ecosystem to biotic invasions.
I will use a combination of complex network theory---built upon tools from statistical physics and the social sciences---and dynamic models of the populations of the species in the community[@Bastolla2009; @Garcia-Algarra2013]. 
This approach will allow me to to determine when invasions are likely to lead to a regime shift [@Romanuk2009; @Rohr2014; @Tylianakis2014]. 

Biotic invasions often occur in ecosystems that have already been degraded [@Bennett2015]. 
Also, theoretical and empirical evidence shows that the degree of species functional redundancy has major effects on ecosystem stability [@Walker1999; @Fonseca2001; @Bellwood2003b; @Loreau2004; @Allison2008; @Brandl2014a]. 
My second objective is to determine how biodiversity loss---from a functional perspective---affects the resilience of an ecosystem. 
To answer that question I will extend the theoretical models I will develop and contrast them with previously collected empirical data.
I will compare the role of species in invaded vs. non-invaded ecosystems, and before vs. after regime shifts.
I aim to to quantify how ecosystem's resilience changes due to the structural and dynamic changes generated by the loss of species and invasive species.
In turn, I will be able to determine how  diversity within species functional groups affects ecosystem resilience [@Rohr2014].

I will use a similar approach for my third objective: to translate the gained insight into useful lessons for ecosystem management.
Recent work in theoretical physics has highlighted the possibility of controlling a complex system, by inducing perturbations that compensate for previous disturbances [@Cornelius2013].
Because this approach has never been used in ecology, I propose to build upon it to find how ecosystems can be managed to maximise resilience, rather than managing for individual species.
I aim to determine the feasibility of using this approach to modify an ecosystem state, or to rescue it from the brink of collapse.

Over the last years I have focused on the ecology of tropical marine organisms, and witnessed how entire ecosystems are transformed due to human pressures.
Understanding what makes ecosystems vulnerable, and how to prevent and revert these undesirable transformations became my top scientific interest.
I want to answer fundamental questions in ecology, and ultimately improve the management of the ecosystems I love.
I am aware that this is likely to guide my scientific career for the next decade.
The support from the NZIDRS is going to be instrumental to reach this goal.

Funder guidelines:

* Your proposal should be thoroughly researched, well thought out, feasible, and clearly articulated
* Your proposal should identify specific areas of study and outline methodology
* Include an assessment of the benefits (both professional and personal) that you expect from your proposed research

Considerations:

1. Hook attention from the get go
2. Make sure it fits what they want
3. Audience = no idea about anthing
4. I matter. Sell myself. Carrer highlights and contributions to date
5. Good title. Grandma should understand it, avoid questions, short and to the point, tell why is so bloody important
6. Tell. What I'm gonna do. WHy is so exciting. What will it solve
7. Tell inmediatelly what I'm intending to reseracg. An assessor wants to see that youâ€™ll be proposing to do x, y and z such that you can answer big questions a, b and c efficiently, effectively and convincingly.
8. Convince it's exciting. Make anyone who read it excited
9. Explain applied outcomes. how your results will affect the real world, either through policy, technology or remediation
10. State hypothesis and predictions and how to test them. Be realistic about them
11. Methodologically specific. 
12. Communication strategy. Reaches for the public with clever and inovative ways
