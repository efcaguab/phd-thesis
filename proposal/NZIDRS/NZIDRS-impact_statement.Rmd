It has been recently shown that the architecture of networks of species interactions is essential for the maintenance of global biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and therefore it can mediate the respose of ecosystems to disturbances [@Rezende2007; @Bastolla2009; @Berlow2009; @Stouffer2010; @Stouffer2012]. 
However, very few studies have investigated the link between species interactions and reslience [@Lever2014; @Tylianakis2014]. 
My proposed research aims to improve our current understanding of the ecosystem responses to multiple anthopogenic drivers and their cumulative impacts. 
In particular, I will quantify the role played by species interactions in modulating ecosystem resilience.

To answer those questions, I will center on model systems and drivers that have global relevance, but are particularly important for New Zealand. 
Specifically I will focus on 1) mutuallistic plant-pollinator networks which are of tremendous importantance for the maintenance of biodiversity and production of crops [@Bascompte2007; @Klein2007]; and 2) biotic invasions and defaunation wich are top components of human-caused global change for which New Zealand has both suffered and remains notably vulnerable [@Vitousek1997]. 
About two thirds of New Zealand plants are pollinated by birds or insects. 
Moreover they are responsible for the pollination of iconic native plants (like kowhai and pohutukawa), and economically important crops (like kiwifruit, apples and grapes). 
This implies that New Zealand flora is particularly vulnerable to declines in pollination services [@Newstrom2005], and those services have already been distorted by the introduction of foreign bees [@Huryn1995] and the population depeltion of native birds[@Anderson2003; @Robertson2009].
Also, in contrast with other locations, pollination networks in New Zealand are dominated by generalist species[@Heine1937; @Primack1983]---plants that attract a wide range of pollinator species, and pollinators that visit a wide range of plants. 
My proposed research will help elucidate how this structural differences are reflected on the resilience and stability of New Zealand's pollination systems when considering that original ecosystems have been changed by invasive species.
Understanding how invasions interact with defaunation in ecological networks is a global research priority, and essential for conserving, restoring and managing New Zealand ecosystems [@Newstrom2005]. 

The results of my research will also have direct application to ecosystem management, and in the future clear conservation benefits not only for New Zealand, but also ecosystems elsewhere. 
For example, the introduction, and posterior invasion, of stoats in New Zealand was an expensive mistake in which species interactions were not taken into account. 
What is more, although we know the effects of this invasion on iconic native species, we currently do not understand how the changes on ecosystem dynamics is affecting the resilience of the ecosystems as a whole.
The research I propose intends to establish a general theory neccessary to answer this question. 
This is particularly important when the ecosystem response might be inconspicous until transformation is inminent.
By better understading the dynamics behind species interactions, we will hopefully be better prepared to anticipate, prevent and reverse unwanted ecosystem transformations.

My PhD will take place at [Dr. Daniel Stouffer's lab](http://www.stoufferlab.org/)---a Rutherfurd Discovery Fellow at the University of Canterbury. 
His interdisciplinary research group is very active internationally and regularly receives visiting scientists. 
To mention some, current collaborations include scientist from the Universidade de Sao Paulo (Brasil), the Ecole Normale Superieure (France), and the University of Queensland (Australia). 
My proposed project also aligns nicely with the interests of several highly cited researchers with whom collaborations might be very advantageous: [Jason Tylianakis](http://www.tylianakislab.org/) (University of Canterbury), [Jordi Bascompte](http://www.bascompte.net/) (University of Zurich), [Martin Scheffer](http://www.sparcs-center.org/) (Wagenigen University), and [Carl Folke](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/21/contact/staff/1-15-2008-folke.html) (Stockholm Resilience Center). 

With your support, I will tackle fundamental, globally important, ecological questions that are of especial relevance for New Zealand's natural heritage and agricultural sector.
