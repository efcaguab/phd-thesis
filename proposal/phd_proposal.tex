Natural ecosystems provide important services---like food, recreation, and water---we depend on. 
The functioning of the ecosystems that produce these services is chiefly determined by the network of interactions between the species that inhabit it. 
Human caused stressors, like biological ivasions, defaunation, or habitat degradation, can cause functional transformations that undermine the provisioning of ecosystem services. 
Despite it's importance we dont completely understand the dynamics that lead to these transformations.
My proposed research aims to quantify the role played by species interactions on determining the resilience of ecosystems.
I will use a combination of empirical data, computer simulations and ecological theory. 
By looking at the structural and dynamic properties of ecological networks, I aim to build the fundations for determining why, when and how these unwanted transformations occur.
