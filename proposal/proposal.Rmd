Species in a ecological community form networks of interactions that determine the functioning of the ecosystem. Chiefly, interactions can be antagonistic ---like those between hosts and parasites or plant and herbivores--- or mutualistic ---like those between plants and pollinators or coral and their symbiotic algae. 

Anthropogenic pressures are a major driver of ecosystem change. The way ecosystems respond to those drivers is largely determined by the structure or their interaction networks. Because ecosystem interactions are of tremendous importance for global biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem services, and the maintenance of global biodiversity, understanding the implications of network structure for ecosystem response is paramount.

For my dissertation I propose to study the role of species' interactions on the response of ecosystems to drivers of change. Specifically I aim to build a general understanding of how network structure and species coexistence interplays with the ecosystem's stability, resilience and adaptive capacity. 

These three concepts ---introduced by Holling [-@Holling1973] and later reviewed by Gunderson [-@Gunderson2000]--- have been key in quantifying the dynamics and behaviour of ecosystems. **Stability** describes the property of a system to return to an equilibrium point after disturbance. On the other hand **Resilience** is a meassure of stability that mediates transitions between ecosystem stable states; it is defined by "the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures" (stable states) or as "the return time to a stable state following a perturbation". In turn the **adaptive capacity** describes "the processes that modify ecological resilience".

I start by stuyding the outcome of species invasions under different structures of mutualistic networks. Species invasions are a major driver of change in many ecosystems, with important consequences on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity [@Ehrenfeld2010; @Powell2011; @Thomsen2014]. Mutuallistic networks, on the other hand, are crucial for the maintenance of global biodiversity. For instance mutuallistic networks are responsible of 90% of seed dispersal in tropical plants [@Bascompte2007] and the pollination of arround 70% of the global food crops [@Tylianakis2013]. 

In reality ecosystems dynamics are comprised by feedbacks that include more than one type of interactions. In fact most of our understading of the ecosystem's suceptibility to invasion and its stability comes from studies in the context of antagonistic interactions. I propose to  We already know that the network's structural patterns that promote stability vary depending on the type of interaction [@Thebault2010; @Sauve2014], but little is known about the factors that make an ecosystem more resilient against invasors and other drivers.
