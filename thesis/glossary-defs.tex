\newglossaryentry{network control}{
  name={network control},
  description={a network is said to be controllable if it is possible to steer it from an initial to an arbitrary final state within finite time}}

\newglossaryentry{controllability}{
  name={controllability},
  description={the intrinsic difficulty of controlling an ecological community. It is measured by the relative size of the minimum driver-node set, $n_D$. It also indicates the extent to which network structure can be harnessed for network control}}

\newglossaryentry{minimum driver node set}{
  name={minimum driver-node set},
  description={one of the sets of species whose abundances need to be directly managed in order to achieve full control of the community. The minimum driver-node sets can be obtained by finding all maximum matchings in a network}}

\newglossaryentry{maximum matching}{
  name={maximum matching},
  description={a matching is a set of links that do not share any common start or end nodes; the largest possible matching is called a maximum matching}}

\newglossaryentry{control configuration}{
  name={control configuration},
  description={one of the species combinations with which is possible to achieve network control. Optimal control configurations are given by the minimum driver-node sets}}

\newglossaryentry{control capacity}{
  name={control capacity},
  description={the relative frequency ($\phi$) which with a species is part of the optimal control configurations of a network}}

\newglossaryentry{critical species}{
  name={critical species},
  description={a species with a maximal control capacity ($\phi=1$)}}

\newglossaryentry{superior node}{
  name={superior node},
  description={a species is a superior node if it can internally affect the abundance of other species in the network. Superior nodes make up the chains that propagate the control signals through the network}}
