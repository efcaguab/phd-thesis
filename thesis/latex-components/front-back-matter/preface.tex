\noindent This thesis is composed of three scientific articles.
All of these articles study the processes that influence the structure of pollination networks and their implications.
Each chapter is a standalone piece of research and, therefore, I only provide a brief general Introduction and Conclusion linking chapters together.
In the Introduction (\autoref{introduction}), I focus on describing the joint context from which the research questions tackled in each chapter originate.
In the Conclusion (\autoref{conclusion}), I focus on the relationship between each chapter's results.
Importantly, I discuss the implications of this relationship for our understanding of pollination networks and propose ideas for future research.

In \autoref{cophylogeny} I include another article that, although it did not end up being an integral part my thesis, provided an opportunity to learn and practice essential skills for a successful PhD and eventually led me to the topic of this document.
