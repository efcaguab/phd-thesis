\noindent This thesis is composed of three scientific articles.
All of these articles study the processes that influence the structure of pollination networks and their implications.
Each chapter is a standalone piece of research and, therefore, I only provide a brief general Introduction and Conclusion linking chapters together.
In the Introduction, I focus on describing the joint context from which the research questions tackled in each chapter originate.
In the Conclusion, I focus on the relationship between each chapter's results and sdiscuss the implications of this relationship for our understanding of pollination networks.

In \autoref{cophylogeny} I include another article that, although it did not end up being an integral part my thesis, it represented an important outcome of provided an opportunity to learn and practice essential skills for a successful PhD and eventually led me to the topic of this dissertation.
