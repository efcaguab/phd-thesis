In this thesis I explore some of the causes and consequences of the network of interactions between flowering plants and their pollinators in an ecological community.
First, I explore how network structure can be influenced by the trade-offs that manifest when plants compete for the pollination service. 
Second, I explore how the structure can be influenced by the stresses that the environment exert on plant or pollinator species. 
Third, I explore how the structure can be harnessed to design effective management interventions. 

## Summary of results

In \autoref{the-pollination-trade-off} we found that the number of shared pollinators, which is correlated to the species degree, had a surprisingly low influence in the quality of pollination. 
Other factors like visit potential, functional originality, and abundance had a larger impact on the both the quantity and purity of the pollination service. 
Specifically high visitation and pollen production appears to have a positive effect on the quantity of pollination (the amount of conspecific pollen received), but a negative effect on the purity (the amount of conspecific pollen relative to heterospecific pollen). 
The relative abundance of a species had the opposite trends with a negative effect on pollination quantity and a positive effect on purity. 
Functional originality had a positive albeit smaller effect on both pollination quantity and purity. 
And finally, the number of shared pollinators had a negative effect on both quantity and purity. 

These results indicate that there is no free lunch when species compete for better pollination service. 
Some factors that may be benefitial for the quantity of pollen received may be detrimental for the quality. 
Those that are benefitial for both in the short term, like being specialized or having original traits, have been shown to be a risky strategy when biotic or abiotic conditions change. 

Another remarkable result was that the way species position themselves in this trade-off is not actually inherent to the species itself, but is strongly determined by the community context. 
In other words, plants were flexible on the strategy they use to balance the the factors affecting the trade-offs inherent to the pollination service.
