In this thesis I explored some of the causes and consequences of the network of interactions between flowering plants and their pollinators in an ecological community.
First, I explored how network structure can be influenced by the trade-offs that manifest when plants compete for the pollination service. 
Second, I explored how the structure can be influenced by the stresses that the environment exert on plant or pollinator species. 
Third, I explored how the structure can be harnessed to design effective management interventions. 

## Summary of results

In \autoref{the-pollination-trade-off} I found that the number of shared pollinators, which is correlated to the species degree, had a surprisingly low influence in the quality of pollination. 
Other factors like visit potential, functional originality, and abundance had a larger impact on the both the quantity and purity of the pollination service. 
Specifically high visitation and pollen production appears to have a positive effect on the quantity of pollination (the amount of conspecific pollen received), but a negative effect on the purity (the amount of conspecific pollen relative to heterospecific pollen). 
The relative abundance of a species had the opposite trends with a negative effect on pollination quantity and a positive effect on purity. 
Functional originality had a positive albeit smaller effect on both pollination quantity and purity. 
And finally, the number of shared pollinators had a negative effect on both quantity and purity. 

These results indicate that there is no free lunch when species compete for better pollination service. 
Some factors that may be benefitial for the quantity of pollen received may be detrimental for the quality. 
Those that are benefitial for both in the short term, like being specialized or having original traits, have been shown to be a risky strategy when biotic or abiotic conditions change. 

Another remarkable result was that the way species position themselves in this trade-off is not actually inherent to the species itself, but is strongly determined by the community context. 
In other words, plants were flexible on the strategy they use to balance the the factors affecting the trade-offs inherent to the pollination service. 

In \autoref{sdm-networks}, I found that the environment can also play a role in determining the number of partners a species may have in an ecological community. 
On the one hand it can limit the number of partners a species can interact with in a particular community if the environment in the community lies outside their partners fundamental "Grinellian" niche.  
On the other it can directly influence the size of the species realised "Eltonian niche" so that a species might not necesarly interact with a potential partner, even if the partner is present in the community. 
Specifically, I found that species with a relatively small number of interacting partners under optimal enviornmental conditions are more likely to interact with more species as environmental conditions degrade. 
This is, they interact with a larger proportion of available species; presumably promoting traits related to a larger realised Eltonian niche. 
Contrastingly, species with a relatively large number of inetracting partners were more likely to interact with less species as environmental stress increases. 
The fact that these second group of species favours interactions with a subset of possible species suggest that they might be focusing in fewer but better partners. 

Finally, in \autoref{structural-controllability}, I found that species with a large number of interaction partners are also likely to have a high control capacity and be critical to control the ecological community.
Interestingly, however, we found that being a generalist is not the determining factor for having high control capacity. 
Indeed some species that interact with only a small number of species were also determined to be critical for network control. 
Our analysis indicated that the strongest predictor of control capacity was a species contribution to nestedness. 
Although controlling an ecological community is still not feasible with the current theoretical and practical limitations, identifying these species with high control capacity provides some lessons on the stability of the communities. 
Indeed, we found that critical species, which have the highest possible control capacity, were more likely to disproportionally contribute to the stable coexistence of species in their community.

## General implications

In \autoref{the-pollination-trade-off} we learnt that the number of pollinators a plant species shares has a negative, but small effect in the pollination service. 
This is the benefits of having a relatively large number of partners in the long term might outweight the disadvantages for the pollination service in the long term. 
However the detriment to pollination service is proportional to the species degree and hence there is a point at which the trade-off becomes too large. 
This point is likely to be species dependent.
This might explain, at least in part why pollination networks are relatively generalised but also why they are not perfectly connected. 

From an evolutionary perspective, species can limit the number of interaction partners by developing traits that allow them to interact more effectively with certain species while rendering the interaction with certain others less likely. 
This traits, which together define the "Eltonian" component of the species, can be shaped by the environment, as we learnt from \autoref{sdm-networks}. 
Taken together, the results suggest tha the point at which the net result of intereacting with a large number of species becomes negative can be influenced by the stresses the environment induces in a species. 
This is, the differences between the strategy with wich a species approaches the pollination trade off in a community and another could be an indirect result of the environmental factors it faces. 

Interestingly wether this point was moved backwards depending on the environmental stress, is likely to be related to the traits of the species. 
As noted earlier, species with a small number of interacting partners under optimal enviornmental conditions, and as such possess traits that limit the number of interacting partners, are more likely to interact with more species as environmental conditions degrade. 
Presumably this means they are trading the short term benefits that trait originality confers to the pollination service for the longer term benefits provided by a larger number of interaction partners. 
Contrastingly, species with a large number of partners would be presumably more likely to do the opposite and "select for" partners that provide a better pollination service in the short term. 
Finally, specialist that are unable to gain interaction partners under degraded environmental conditions are more likely to go extinct. 

These conclusions relating the trade-offs in the pollination service and the environment have interesting ramifications for our current understanding of network structure.
Lets imagine a hypothetical community with a nested structure typical of natural pollination communities.
Now lets imagine that we move this community to a different environment in which most species are under higer enironmental stress, similar to what we would expect in a high altitude alpine community or under abrupt climate change. 
Provided enough time for species to adapt their niches to the new conditons, it is plausible to expect some changes on network structure based on the conclusions from \autoref{the-pollination-trade-off} and \autoref{sdm-networks}. 
Specifically, it is plausible to expect an increasse in the level of pollinator sharing among consituent species possibly accompained by an increase in connectance and a reduction of the network nestedness.

The possible increase in connectance is consistent with the prevailing understanding thatmutualistic networks tend to be better connected than networks composed by antagonistic/competitive interactions. 
A reasonable way to maintain species coexistence under increased environmental stress would be to increase the level of intraspecies facilitation compared to competition. 
As found by Bastolla, higher levels of pollinator sharing favour species coexistence *if faciliation predominates*. 
Indeed Lopezaraiza found that facilitation is more predominant than competition in the harsh environment prevalent in high altitude pollination communities.

The possible decrease in nestedness has worrying implications as nestedness has been shown to promote stability and species persistence in pollination communities.
In particicular, Souffer found that strong contributors to nestedness are more vulnerable to extinction. 
This very same species, were the ones that our structural controllability analysis indicated as the ones that are more useful to manage an ecological community.
This is stronger contributors to nestedness tend to have a large control capacity and hence be more likely to influence the abundance of other species. 

## Next steps

There are multiple questions that arise from the conclusions of this thesis. 
First, it would be interesting to 
Confirm that this the trade-offs and environment are related to certain network structure

A controllability analysis that takes into account the traits of species?
