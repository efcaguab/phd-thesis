## Summary {-}

That evolutionary history can influence the way that species interact is a basic tenet of evolutionary ecology. However, when the role of evolution in determining ecological interactions is investigated, focus typically centers on just one side of the interaction. A cophylogenetic signal---the congruence of evolutionary history across both sides of an ecological interaction---extends these previous explorations and provides a more complete picture of how evolutionary patterns influence the way species interact. To date, cophylogenetic signal has most typically been studied in interactions that occur between fine taxonomic clades that show high intimacy. In this study, we took an alternative approach and made an exhaustive assessment of cophylogeny in pollination interactions. To do so, we assessed the strength of cophylogenetic signal at four distinct scales of pollination interaction: *(i)* across plant-pollinator associations globally, \emph{(ii)} in local pollination communities, *(iii)* within the modular structure of those communities, and \emph{(iv)} in individual modules. We did so using a globally-distributed dataset comprised of 54 pollination networks, over 4000 species, and over 12,000 interactions. Within these data, we detected cophylogenetic signal at all four scales. Cophylogenetic signal was found at the level of plant-pollinator interactions on a global scale and in the majority of pollination communities. At the scale defined by the modular structure within those communities, however, we observed a much weaker cophylogenetic signal. Cophylogenetic signal was detectable in a significant proportion of individual modules and most typically when within-module phylogenetic diversity was low. In sum, the detection of cophylogenetic signal in pollination interactions across scales provides a new dimension to the story of how past evolution shapes extant pollinator-angiosperm interactions.

## Introduction

Populations do not exist in isolation but are instead constantly interacting with each other. 
Each of these interactions can impact the fitness of individuals and hence lead to selection for amplification or avoidance of future interactions [@gervasi_real-time_2017; @thompson_geographic_2005]. 
Furthermore, when interactions directly influence the reproductive isolation of one or both species, selection can be powerful enough to cause speciation or extinction events that can potentially intertwine the evolutionary trajectories of pairs of taxa and their descendants [@thompson_geographic_2005]. 
Where selection, regardless of its origin, is strong enough to drive coupled speciation in two interacting clades, the resultant macroscopic pattern is synonymously referred to as cophylogeny, cospeciation, or parallel cladogenesis [@thompson_geographic_2005; @page_tangled_2003].

A cophylogenetic signal implies two observations: that the phylogenies of interacting clades are congruent in structure and that extant interactions occur between evolutionarily coupled taxa [@page_tangled_2003; @desdevises_cophylogeny_2007: @balbuena_paco_2013]. 
A cophylogenetic signal suggests that contemporary ecological associations among species are the product of coupled evolutionary history such that ancestral forms of each species experienced and responded to shared selection pressures [@page_tangled_2003; @aizen_phylogenetic_2016]. 
In contrast, the current paradigm of phylogenetic signal of species interactions suggests only that more closely related species interact in more similar ways [@rezende_non-random_2007; @gomez_ecological_2010; @rafferty_phylogenetic_2013].
Therefore, cophylogenetic signal in ecological networks would suggest that coupled evolutionary history as well as relatedness can determine species interactions, thereby providing additional insights into the role past evolution plays in determining contemporary ecological associations.
	
To date, the vast majority of studies of cophylogeny have centered on host-parasite relationships [@hafner_phylogenetic_1988; @de_vienne_cospeciation_2013], where the focus is often at the relatively fine scale of families and genera [@weckstein_biogeography_2004; @desdevises_cophylogeny_2007; @hughes_multiple_2007; but see @page_tangled_2003; @chomicki_macroevolutionary_2015]. 
If cophylogenetic signal can also be considered a relevant predictor of ecological interactions, it should be detectable in other types of ecological associations. 
In particular, there is an increasing focus on the mutualistic assemblages of flowering plants and their pollinators as another system in which one might expect to detect a cophylogenetic pattern. 
Several recent studies have demonstrated the presence of cophylogeny at the scales of fig-wasp [@marussich_host-specificity_2007; @jousselin_one_2008; @cruaud_extreme_2012] and yucca-moth [@althoff_geographic_2012] pollination interactions [and see @aizen_phylogenetic_2016]. 
Findings such as these---coupled with the facts that the association of angiosperms and pollinators dates back to the Cretaceous period [@crane_origin_1995; @grimaldi_co-radiations_1999] and that there is reasonable evidence to expect that at least some angiosperms and pollinators co-diverged [@grimaldi_co-radiations_1999]---suggest a cophylogenetic signal may be widely identifiable between these groups (Fig.\ \ref{fig:concept}a).
On the other hand, perfect congruence of speciation patterns cannot be expected across such rich and diverse groups after more than 100mya of association. 
Nevertheless, even a weak cophylogenetic signal between angiosperms and their pollinators (i.e., at taxonomic scales above the species level) would provide important evidence that coupled evolution between taxa is an important correlate of their tendency to interact. 

The most relevant scale at which cophylogenetic signal could characterize ecological interactions is that of the community. 
It is already well established that elements of community composition, such as evenness, functional trait diversity and interaction structure have an element of phylogenetic determinism [@webb_phylogenies_2002; @eklof_phylogenetic_2016; @harmon-threatt_filtering_2013; @emerson_phylogenetic_2008; @vamosi_emerging_2009]. 
Hence, even when recognizing the various caveats of a phylogenetic approach to community ecology [@mayfield_opposing_2010; @losos_seeing_2011], there are clear implications should cophylogenetic signal be detectable in ecological communities. 
For instance, many studies have focused on how the evolutionary history of a single group (e.g. forest trees, pollinators) influences community structure [@cavender-bares_phylogenetic_2006; @kembel_phylogenetic_2006; @danieli-silva_pollination_2012]; in contrast, detectable cophylogenetic signal would suggest that observed interactions tend to occur between taxa that show coupled evolutionary history and therefore that the structure of pollination networks is, at least partially, the by-product of this evolutionary coupling of taxa (Fig.\ \ref{fig:concept}b).
Although recent findings for a set of related networks indicate that cophylogenetic signal may be detectable in pollination networks [@aizen_phylogenetic_2016], it is currently unclear whether or not this is generally the case. 

At the same time, ecological communities can also be stochastic assemblages of species and interactions [@hubbell_unified_2001; @cottenie_integrating_2005] and the value of examining smaller groups of closely interacting species has been shown time and again [@paine_Food_1966; @estes_sea_1974; @olesen_modularity_2007; @rezende_compartments_2009]. 
Therefore, it is entirely possible that a cophylogenetic signal also permeates to finer scales within a community. 
Indeed, ecological networks are known to have identifiable structural features including being characterized by modules of closely interacting subsets of the community [@barber_modularity_2007; @thebault_stability_2010]. 
Modules---a pervasive feature in pollination networks [@olesen_modularity_2007]---are thought to play crucial roles in ecological community resilience [@thebault_stability_2010] and may represent a fundamental unit of coevolution [@olesen_modularity_2007; @bascompte_mutualistic_2014].
As such, these tight sets of interacting species may provide a more ecologically relevant scale at which cophylogenetic signal could act. 
On the one hand, a network's modular structure may show the clearest cophylogenetic signal (Fig.\ \ref{fig:concept}c). 
On the other hand, many different processes have been causally attributed to ecological module formation [@olesen_modularity_2007; @rezende_compartments_2009; @krasnov_phylogenetic_2012; @rohr_structural_2014; @schleuning_ecological_2014], implying that some individual modules within networks may be better characterized by cophylogenetic signal than others (Fig.\ \ref{fig:concept}d).
		
For a network's modular structure to show a cophylogenetic pattern, two constraints must be satisfied (Fig.\ \ref{fig:concept}c). First, the modular structure should embody the phylogenetic congruence of the network such that modules represent groupings of closely related species on each side of the network. However, this mapping of each side of the modules to phylogenies does not take into account the degree to which those interactions within modules occur between evolutionarily-coupled plants and pollinators. Thus second, a network's modules should also be comprised of the interactions that contribute most to the cophylogenetic signal of the network while interactions that contribute less should tend to fall between modules. At the even finer scale of individual modules, a module could be considered to show cophylogenetic signal when just its interactions show greater cophylogenetic signal than expected by chance (Fig. \ref{fig:concept}d).

Here, we explore cophylogenetic signal between plants and their pollinators in 54 pollination networks from around the world that together provide a taxonomically and geographically diverse dataset. In particular, we leverage these data to quantify the evidence of cophylogenetic signal at the four distinct scales mentioned previously (Fig.\ \ref{fig:concept}): \emph{(i)} cophylogenetic signal between angiosperms and pollinators globally, \emph{(ii)} community cophylogenetic signal---where evolutionary congruence between species should be embodied by the interactions of the entire network, \emph{(iii)} cophylogenetic signal of a network's modular structure---where the modular structure of a network should tend to contain more closely related plant species, more closely related pollinator species, and the most evolutionarily congruent interactions between them, and \emph{(iv)} individual module cophylogenetic signal---where interactions within a module should be more cophylogenetic than expected by chance. Detectable cophylogenetic signal across these four scales suggests that, at least in plant-pollinator associations, the evolutionary determinants of extant interactions are a product of both interacting species rather than arising from only the phylogenetic relatedness on one side of the interaction.
