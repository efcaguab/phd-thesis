  abstract = {Hummingbirds and their floral resources in a forest fragment in Vi{\c c}osa, southeastern Brazil. Between August 1998 and August 1999, hummingbirds and plant species used by an them as nectar sources were recorded in the Mata do Para{\'i}so forest reserve. This area is a regeneration of Atlantic Forest with an area of 194.36 ha. It is located in the municipality of Vi{\c c}osa, in the Forest Zone of Minas Gerais. Fourteen plant species were visited by the hummingbirds as floral resources, 11 of them ornitophilous and three entomophilous. Most of the plant species occures in the understore or in the forest edges, presenting herbaceous or creeper habitus and bloom in during the rainy season. During the dry season, Geissomeria schottiana and Ruellia brevifolia seemed to be the main nectar sources for the hummingbirds. In five ornitophilous species of Acanthaceae, we recorded six of the eight hummingbird species, confirming the importance of this family for the maintenance of hummingbirds in the reserve. Phaethornis ruber was the most common hummingbird observed (it visited flowers of 10 species), followed by P. squalidus (nine species) and Thalurania glaucopis (four species). Males of T. glaucopis displayed territorial behavior when visiting flowers of G. schottiana and Mendoncia velloziana.},

  abstract = {Nestedness has been one of the most reported patterns of species distribution in metacommunities as well as of species interactions in bipartite networks. We propose here a straightforward approach for quantifying nestedness using quantitative instead of presenceeabsence data. We named our estimator WNODF because it is a simple modification of the nestedness index called NODF. We also introduce the NODF-Program that calculates the above described nestedness metrics as well as metrics for idiosyncratic species and sites. Statistical inference is done through a null model approach, in which the user can choose among five null models commonly used for presenceeabsence matrices as well as three randomization algorithms for matrices that contain quantitative data. The program performs multiple analyses using many matrices. Finally, the NODF-Program provides four sorting options that, together with the null algorithms, cover a range of possibilities to test hypotheses on the possible mechanisms producing nested patterns. By using a set of model matrices, we showed that WNODF differentiates nested matrices with distinct structures and correctly identifies matrices with no nested pattern as having zero degree of nestedness.},

The causes of this among-species variation are unknown, however, prompting the investigation of underlying factors. Here, we conducted a hand-pollination experiment with ten co-flowering species to determine whether the effects of heterospecific pollen receipt are mediated by the pollen donor or recipient species alone, or whether the effects are determined by the interaction between them. We further assessed species traits potentially mediating interactive effects in heterospecific pollen receipt by evaluating the relationship between heterospecific pollen effect size and three different predictors reflecting a unique combination of pollen donor and recipient characteristics. Our results show, for the first time, that the magnitude of the heterospecific pollen receipt effect is determined by the specific combination of donor and recipient species (i.e., interactive effects). However, we were unable to uncover the specific combination of traits mediating these effects. Overall, our study provides strong evidence that an understanding of heterospecific pollen receipt effects based on recipient or donor characteristics alone may be insufficient. This study is an important step toward an understanding of consequences of heterospecific pollen receipt in co-flowering communities.},

  abstract = {The difficulty of experimentally quantifying non-trophic species interactions has long troubled ecologists. Increasingly, a new application of the classic ``checkerboard distribution'' approach is used to infer interactions by examining the pairwise frequency at which species are found to spatially co-occur. However, the link between spatial associations, as estimated from observational co-occurrence, and species interactions has not been tested. Here we used nine common statistical methods to estimate associations from surveys of rocky intertidal communities in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. We compared those inferred associations with a new data set of experimentally determined net and direct species interactions. Although association methods generated networks with aggregate structure similar to previously published interaction networks, each method detected a different set of species associations from the same data set. Moreover, although association methods generally performed better than a random model, associations rarely matched empirical net or direct species interactions, with high rates of false positives and true positives, and many false negatives. Our findings cast doubt on studies that equate species co-occurrences to species interactions and highlight a persistent, unanswered question: how do we interpret spatial patterns in communities? We suggest future research directions to unify the observational and experimental study of species interactions, and discuss the need for community standards and best practices in association analysis.},

  abstract = {Decades of research have demonstrated that many calcifying species are negatively affected by ocean acidification, a major anthropogenic threat in marine ecosystems. However, even closely related species may exhibit different responses to ocean acidification and less is known about the drivers that shape such variation in different species. Here, we examine the drivers of physiological performance under ocean acidification in a group of five species of turf-forming coralline algae. Specifically, quantitating the relative weight of evidence for each of ten hypotheses, we show that variation in coralline calcification and photosynthesis was best explained by allometric traits. Across ocean acidification conditions, larger individuals (measured as noncalcified mass) had higher net calcification and photosynthesis rates. Importantly, our approach was able to not only identify the aspect of size that drove the performance of coralline algae, but also determined that responses to ocean acidification were not dependent on species identity, evolutionary relatedness, habitat, shape, or structural composition. In fact, we found that failure to test multiple, alternative hypotheses would underestimate the generality of physiological performances, leading to the conclusion that each species had different baseline performance under ocean acidification. Testing among alternative hypotheses is an essential step toward determining the generalizability of experiments across taxa and identifying common drivers of species responses to global change.},

  abstract = {The structural organization of mutualism networks, typified by interspecific positive interactions, is important to maintain community diversity. However, there is little information available about the effect of introduced species on the structure of such networks. We compared uninvaded and invaded ecological communities, to examine how two species of invasive plants with large and showy flowers (Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta) affect the structure of Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. To attribute differences in pollination to the direct presence of the invasive species, areas were surveyed that contained similar native plant species cover, diversity and floral composition, with or without the invaders. Both invasive plant species received significantly more pollinator visits than any native species and invaders interacted strongly with pollinators. Overall, the pollinator community richness was similar in invaded and uninvaded plots, and only a few generalist pollinators visited invasive species exclusively. Invasive plants acted as pollination super generalists. The two species studied were visited by 43\% and 31\% of the total insect taxa in the community, respectively, suggesting they play a central role in the plant-pollinator networks. Carpobrotus and Opuntia had contrasting effects on pollinator visitation rates to native plants: Carpobrotus facilitated the visit of pollinators to native species, whereas Opuntia competed for pollinators with native species, increasing the nestedness of the plant-pollinator network. These results indicate that the introduction of a new species to a community can have important consequences for the structure of the plant-pollinator network.},

These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceeds in these highly diversified mutualisms among freeliving species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., phenology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure has important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},

To address gaps in previous studies, we measured herbivory and defence in the same system, quantified defence with bioassays, and considered effects of leaf age. We quantified herbivory and defence of young and mature leaves along a continental gradient in eastern North America in the native herb Phytolacca americana L. Herbivory in the field declined with latitude and was strongly correlated with lepidopteran abundance. Laboratory bioassays revealed that leaf palatability was positively correlated with latitude of origin. Young leaves were more damaged than mature leaves at lower latitudes in the field, but less palatable in bioassays. Both defence and palatability displayed non-linear latitudinal patterns, suggesting potential mechanisms based on biological or climatic thresholds. In sum, observational and experimental studies find patterns consistent with high herbivore pressure and stronger plant defences at lower latitudes.},

We identify the driver reactions facilitating control of 23 metabolic networks from all kingdoms of life. We find that unicellular organisms require smaller degree of control than multicellular organisms. Driver reactions are under complex cellular regulation in Escherichia coli, indicating their preeminent role in facilitating cellular control. In human cancer cells driver reactions play pivotal roles in malignancy and represent potential therapeutic targets. The developed framework helps us gain insights into regulatory principles of diseases and facilitates design of engineering strategies at the interface of gene regulation, signaling, and metabolism.},

  abstract = {Successful implementation of sustainability ideas in ecosystem management requires a basic understanding of the often non-linear and non-intuitive relationships among different dimensions of sustainability, particularly the system-wide implications of human actions. This basic understanding further includes a sense of the time scale of possible future events and the limits of what is and is not likely to be possible. With this understanding, systematic approaches based on control theory can then be used to develop policy guidelines for the system. Therefore, controllability of the system is very important to determining long term sustainability of the system. An article Liu et al. (2011, Nature, 473, 167) presents a new analytical approach to study the controllability of complex systems. We apply this approach to three dynamic systems developed to study the sustainability of our planet. These three systems consist of an ecosystem based on wild and domesticated compartments: a simple economic model, an ecosystem model with an industrial system, and an integrated model involving the ecosystem, industrial systems, and energy producers. The goal is not to develop detailed predictions, but to explore the feasibility of general strategies for sustainability, and to establish scientific criteria which would indicate their likelihood of being successful. We argue that controllability of this system is necessary for its long-term sustainability, and we present our arguments in the light of previous studies of these systems.},

  abstract = {The topology of ecological interaction webs holds important information for theories of coevolution, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability [1\textendash{}6]. However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels [7\textendash{}9]. We applied a recently developed [10] quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating significantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were significantly more specialized than seeddispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions.},

Roughly, constancy is the tendency of the pollinator to continue searching for a flower of the species last visited. The model involves an abundant plant species A and two uncommon plant species, B and C, where the pollinator does not distinguish between B and C. The effect on the frequency of pollinator visits to species B when C has newly invaded the colony is determined. It is shown that, under the right conditions, constancy and competition for pollinator services can result in an explosion in the number of specimens of B present in future generations. Conversely, if C becomes extinct constancy and competition for pollinator services can result in the extinction of species B.},

  abstract = {Pollination network studies are based on pollinator surveys conducted on focal plants. This plant-centred approach provides insufficient information on flower visitation habits of rare pollinator species, which are the majority in pollinator communities. As a result, pollination networks contain very high proportions of pollinator species linked to a single plant species (extreme specialists), a pattern that contrasts with the widely accepted view that plant\textendash{}pollinator interactions are mostly generalized. In this study of a Mediterranean scrubland community in NE Spain we supplement data from an intensive field survey with the analysis of pollen loads carried by pollinators. We observed 4265 contacts corresponding to 19 plant and 122 pollinator species. The addition of pollen data unveiled a very significant number of interactions, resulting in important network structural changes. Connectance increased 1.43-fold, mean plant connectivity went from 18.5 to 26.4, and mean pollinator connectivity from 2.9 to 4.1. Extreme specialist pollinator species decreased 0.6-fold, suggesting that ecological specialization is often overestimated in plant\textendash{}pollinator networks. We expected a greater connectivity increase in rare species, and consequently a decrease in the level of asymmetric specialization. However, new links preferentially attached to already highly connected nodes and, as a result, both nestedness and centralization increased. The addition of pollen data revealed the existence of four clearly defined modules that were not apparent when only field survey data were used. Three of these modules had a strong phenological component. In comparison to other pollination webs, our network had a high proportion of connector links and species. That is, although significant, the four modules were far from isolated.},

We address this knowledge gap by quantifying the within-season turnover of plant\textendash{}pollinator interactions from weekly censuses across 3 years in a subalpine ecosystem. Week-to-week turnover of interactions (1) was high, (2) followed a consistent seasonal progression in all years of study and (3) was dominated by interaction rewiring (the reassembly of interactions among species). Simulation models revealed that species' phenologies and relative abundances constrained both total interaction turnover and rewiring. Our findings reveal the diversity of species interactions that may be missed when the temporal dynamics of networks are ignored.},

  abstract = {Although rarely tested, it is often assumed that interspecific competition results in the divergence of traits related to resource use. Using a plant-pollinator system as a model, I tested the prediction the presence of a competitor for pollination influences the strength and/or direction of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits. I measured phenotypic selection via female fitness on five floral traits of Ipomopsis aggregate in seven populations. Four contained only conspecifics (I only) and three also contained the competitor Castilleja linariaefolia (C + I). Directional selection via fruits/plant and nonspecific pollen deposited/flower on corolla length was positive and significantly stronger in C + I populations. This difference in selection was apparently driven by interpopulation variation in the degree to which reproduction of L aggregate was pollen limited. Consistent with expectations of interspecific competition, L aggregate plants in C + I populations received less nonspecific pollen per flower and set fewer seeds per fruit and fruits per plant than those in I only populations. Ipomopsis aggregata's corollas were also significantly longer in C + Ipopulations, suggesting that there had been a response to a similar selective regime in past generations. Phenotypic correlations between corolla length and width, which determine the variation in L aggregata's flower shape, were significantly weaker in C + I populations. These data suggest that competition for pollination can influence the strength of selection on and patterns of correlations among floral traits of L aggregate. If L aggregate populations with and without competitors for pollination are linked by gene flow, then measuring selection in competitive and noncompetitive environments maybe necessary to accurately predict how floral traits will evolve.},

We show that the potential for one plant species to influence another indirectly via shared pollinators was greater for plants whose resources were more abundant (higher floral unit number and nectar sugar content) and more accessible. The potential indirect influence was also stronger between phylogenetically closer plant species and was independent of plant geographic origin (native vs. non-native). The positive effect of nectar sugar content and phylogenetic proximity was much more accentuated for bees than for other groups. Consequently, the impact of these factors depends on the pollination mode of plants, e.g. bee or fly pollinated.

  abstract = {Many different concepts have been used to describe species' roles in food webs (i.e., the ways in which species participate in their communities as consumers and resources). As each concept focuses on a different aspect of food-web structure, it can be difficult to relate these concepts to each other and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of ``gray areas'' between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species' niches (if any) they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species' roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.},

A fundamental property of networks is that perturbations to one node can affect other nodes, potentially causing the entire system to change behaviour or fail. Here we show that it is possible to exploit the same principle to control network behaviour. Our approach accounts for the nonlinear dynamics inherent to real systems, and allows bringing the system to a desired target state even when this state is not directly accessible due to constraints that limit the allowed interventions. Applications show that this framework permits reprogramming a network to a desired task, as well as rescuing networks from the brink of failure-which we illustrate through the mitigation of cascading failures in a power-grid network and the identification of potential drug targets in a signalling network of human cancer.},

  abstract = {Understanding variations in habitat use through time contributes to identification of habitats critical for species survival. Here we used passive acoustic telemetry to examine the residency and site fidelity patterns of the reef manta ray Mobula alfredi at Lady Elliot Island (LEI), a key aggregation site in eastern Australia. Six acoustic receivers were moored around LEI between 2009 and 2012, and 34 acoustic transmitters were deployed on manta rays. All tagged animals returned to this site within their recording period, with some individuals visiting the area for up to 23 consecutive days. Using a set of mixed effect models, we analysed the hourly visitation patterns of manta rays in relation to temporal and environmental variables. Diel phase and sea temperature showed the strongest effects on the presence of manta rays, with weaker effects detected for wind direction, wind speed and moon illumination. Individuals occupied LEI habitat mostly during daylight hours and in calm weather conditions, which may be linked with behavioural thermoregulation, social interactions and cleaning activities. Their absence at night may be related to foraging strategies in deeper offshore waters. The effect of sea temperature reflects the greater seasonal occurrence of manta rays at LEI in winter, when temperatures are coolest, potentially in response to regional food availability. The high degree of manta ray site fidelity at aggregation sites underscores the importance of these areas as key daytime habitats for the species. We suggest that conservation measures should prioritise the protection of coastal aggregation habitats from overexploitation and degradation.},

Species trait diversity also affects ecosystem functioning and resilience, yet it remains unknown whether species' contributions to functional diversity relate to their network roles. Here, we use 21 empirical pollen transport networks to characterise this relationship. We found that, apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners. Conversely, these effects were not detected in plants, potentially because key aspects of their flowering traits are conserved at a family level. Relating functional and network roles can provide further insight into mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning.},

Although the integration of control theory and network analysis is important, we argue that the application of the structural controllability framework to most if not all real-world networks leads to the conclusion that a single control input, applied to the power dominating set, is all that is needed for structural controllability. This result is consistent with the well-known fact that controllability and its dual observability are generic properties of systems. We argue that more important than issues of structural controllability are the questions of whether a system is almost uncontrollable, whether it is almost unobservable, and whether it possesses almost pole-zero cancellations.},

Flowers on small and large plants received equal amounts of outcross pollen, whereas flowers on large plants received more self pollen, so the proportion of self pollen delivered through geitonogamy increased with plant size. In natural populations emasculation of all flowers on a plant raised average seed set per flower from 5.19 to 6.99 and also raised fruit set, though not significantly. From these results one expects a negative correlation between plant size and seeds per flower. The opposite trend was observed in a sample of plants in the field, suggesting that deleterious effects of geitonogamy on female fecundity in large plants can be overruled by other factors such as size-related fruit or seed abortion. Results are discussed in relation to the evolution of gynodioecy.},

We then applied two alternative restoration strategies in silico (restoring for functional complementarity or redundancy) to data from our early successional plots to examine whether different strategies affected the restoration trajectories. Changes in network structure were explained by a combination of age, tree density and variation in tree diameter, even when variance explained by undergrowth structure was accounted for first. A combination of field data, a network approach and numerical simulations helped to identify which species should be given restoration priority in the context of different restoration targets. This combined approach provides a powerful tool for directing management decisions, particularly when management seeks to restore or conserve ecosystem function.},

@article{dobson_habitat_2006,
  abstract = {The provisioning of sustaining goods and services that we obtain from natural ecosystems is a strong economic justification for the conservation of biological diversity. Understanding the relationship between these goods and services and changes in the size, arrangement, and quality of natural habitats is a fundamental challenge of natural resource management. In this paper, we describe a new approach to assessing the implications of habitat loss for loss of ecosystem services by examining how the provision of different ecosystem services is dominated by species from different trophic levels. We then develop a mathematical model that illustrates how declines in habitat quality and quantity lead to sequential losses of trophic diversity. The model suggests that declines in the provisioning of services will initially be slow but will then accelerate as species from higher trophic levels are lost at faster rates. Comparison of these patterns with empirical examples of ecosystem collapse (and assembly) suggest similar patterns occur in natural systems impacted by anthropogenic change. In general, ecosystem goods and services provided by species in the upper trophic levels will be lost before those provided by species lower in the food chain. The decrease in terrestrial food chain length predicted by the model parallels that observed in the oceans following overexploitation. The large area requirements of higher trophic levels make them as susceptible to extinction as they are in marine systems where they are systematically exploited. Whereas the traditional species\textendash{}area curve suggests that 50\% of species are driven extinct by an order-of-magnitude decline in habitat abundance, this magnitude of loss may represent the loss of an entire trophic level and all the ecosystem services performed by the species on this trophic level.},

  abstract = {Food-web structure mediates dramatic effects of biodiversity loss including secondary and `cascading' extinctions. We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

The GGM shows which variables predict one-another, allows for sparse modeling of covariance structures, and may highlight potential causal relationships between observed variables. We describe the utility in three kinds of psychological data sets: data sets in which consecutive cases are assumed independent (e.g., cross-sectional data), temporally ordered data sets (e.g., n = 1 time series), and a mixture of the 2 (e.g., n {$>$} 1 time series). In timeseries analysis, the GGM can be used to model the residual structure of a vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also termed graphical VAR. Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal network and a contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of stationary means\textemdash{}the between-subjects network. We discuss the interpretation of these models and propose estimation methods to obtain these networks, which we implement in the R packages graphicalVAR and mlVAR. The methods are showcased in two empirical examples, and simulation studies on these methods are included in the supplementary materials.},

@article{fang_paradoxical_2016,
  abstract = {Pollinators visiting multiple plant species may cause heterospecific pollen transfer (HPT). To test a null model that more pollinator interspecific moves result in higher HPT among interacting species, we quantified the comparative magnitudes of the two networks involving 14 co-flowering species in an alpine meadow in the eastern Himalaya, southwest China. Interspecific moves accounted for 4\% of the total visits, whereas heterospecific pollen constituted 22\% of the total stigmatic pollen loads. On average, plant species received interspecific moves and HPT from 6.9 and 9.7 other species, respectively. Although the two networks were largely concordant, 21.6\% of interspecific move links were not correspondingly linked by HPT, and 44.1\% of heterospecific pollen transfer links were not linked by moves. Plant species with more outgoing pollinator moves tended to disperse more of their own pollen to others, as expected. Surprisingly, our data reveal that plant species which received more pollinator moves from other species tended to receive less HP, implying that only species with low acceptance of HP were likely to permit frequent pollinator moves. These new findings unveil a paradoxical relation between pollinator interspecific moves and HP receipt, suggesting an adaptive strategy of co-flowering species that reduces deleterious effects of HPT. Key words: alpine meadow; ecological network; heterospecific pollen transfer, plant-pollinator interaction; pollen carryover; pollinator interspecific move.},

  abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970\textendash{}2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5\textendash{}15\% (0.07\textendash{}0.17 {$\circ$}C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were {$\geq$} 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

  abstract = {Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial distribution and abundance of species. Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but also by the way these interactions vary across time and space. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modelling. We apply this framework to host parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact. This first attempt to explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new perspectives at the interface of species distribution modelling and community ecology.},

The structure of the complex network defining the interactions provides insight into the function and evolution of the components of the system. Unfortunately, the large size and intricacy of these networks implies that such insight is usually difficult to extract. Here, we propose a method that allows one to systematically extract and display information contained in complex networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that one can (i) find modules in complex networks and (ii) classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of within- and between-module connections. The method thus yields a `cartographic representation' of complex networks.},

How biotic resistance develops over time in these ecosystems will depend on how established invaders contribute to subsequent resistance. If invasion success and defence capacity (i.e. contribution to resistance) are correlated, then community resistance should increase as species accumulate. If successful invaders also cause most impact (through replacing native species with low defence capacity) then the effect will be even stronger. If successful invaders instead have weak defence capacity or even facilitative attributes, then resistance should decrease with time, as proposed by the invasional meltdown hypothesis. We analysed 1157 introductions of freshwater fish in Swedish lakes and found that species' invasion success was positively correlated with their defence capacity and impact, suggesting that these communities will develop stronger resistance over time. These insights can be used to identify scenarios where invading species are expected to cause large impact.},

Building on Hutchinson's concept of the ecological niche, this factor analysis compares, in the multidimensional space of ecological variables, the distribution of the localities where the focal species was observed to a reference set describing the whole study area. The first factor extracted maximizes the marginality of the focal species, defined as the ecological distance between the species optimum and the mean habitat within the reference area. The other factors maximize the specialization of this focal species, defined as the ratio of the ecological variance in mean habitat to that observed for the focal species. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are readily interpreted and can be used to build habitat-suitability maps. This approach is recommended in situations where absence data are not available (many data banks), unreliable (most cryptic or rare species), or meaningless (invaders). We provide an illustration and validation of the method for the alpine ibex, a species reintroduced in Switzerland which presumably has not yet recolonized its entire range.},

  abstract = {Plant\textendash{}pollinator interactions are essential for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, but are increasingly affected by global change. The risks to such mutualistic interactions from increasing temperature and more frequent extreme climatic events such as drought or advanced snow melt are assumed to depend on network specialization, species richness, local climate and associated parameters such as the amplitude of extreme events. Even though elevational gradients provide valuable model systems for climate change and are accompanied by changes in species richness, responses of plant\textendash{}pollinator networks to climatic extreme events under different environmental and biotic conditions are currently unknown. Here, we show that elevational climatic gradients, species richness and experimentally simulated extreme events interactively change the structure of mutualistic networks in alpine grasslands. We found that the degree of specialization in plant\textendash{}pollinator networks (H20) decreased with elevation. Nonetheless, network specialization increased after advanced snow melt at high elevations, whereas changes in network specialization after drought were most pronounced at sites with low species richness. Thus, changes in network specialization after extreme climatic events depended on climatic context and were buffered by high species richness. In our experiment, only generalized plant\textendash{}pollinator networks changed in their degree of specialization after climatic extreme events. This indicates that contrary to our assumptions, network generalization may not always foster stability of mutualistic interaction networks.},

  abstract = {We develop an approach for studying population dynamics resulting from mutualism by employing functional responses based on density-dependent benefits and costs. These functional responses express how the population growth rate of a mutualist is modified by the density of its partner. We present several possible dependencies of gross benefits and costs, and hence net effects, to a mutualist as functions of the density of its partner. Net effects to mutualists are likely a monotonically saturating or unimodal function of the density of their partner. We show that fundamental differences in the growth, limitation, and dynamics of a population can occur when net effects to that population change linearly, unimodally, or in a saturating fashion. We use the mutualism between senita cactus and its pollinating seed-eating moth as an example to show the influence of different benefit and cost functional responses on population dynamics and stability of mutualisms. We investigated two mechanisms that may alter this mutualism's functional responses: distribution of eggs among flowers and fruit abortion. Differences in how benefits and costs vary with density can alter the stability of this mutualism. In particular, fruit abortion may allow for a stable equilibrium where none could otherwise exist.},

  abstract = {That evolutionary history can influence the way that species interact is a basic tenet of evolutionary ecology. However, when the role of evolution in determining ecological interactions is investigated, focus typically centers on just one side of the interaction. A cophylogenetic signal, the congruence of evolutionary history across both sides of an ecological interaction, extends these previous explorations and provides a more complete picture of how evolutionary patterns influence the way species interact. To date, cophylogenetic signal has most typically been studied in interactions that occur between fine taxonomic clades that show high intimacy. In this study, we took an alternative approach and made an exhaustive assessment of cophylogeny in pollination interactions. To do so, we assessed the strength of cophylogenetic signal at four distinct scales of pollination interaction: (1) across plant\textendash{}pollinator associations globally, (2) in local pollination communities, (3) within the modular structure of those communities, and (4) in individual modules. We did so using a globally distributed dataset comprised of 54 pollination networks, over 4000 species, and over 12,000 interactions. Within these data, we detected cophylogenetic signal at all four scales. Cophylogenetic signal was found at the level of plant\textendash{}pollinator interactions on a global scale and in the majority of pollination communities. At the scale defined by the modular structure within those communities, however, we observed a much weaker cophylogenetic signal. Cophylogenetic signal was detectable in a significant proportion of individual modules and most typically when withinmodule phylogenetic diversity was low. In sum, the detection of cophylogenetic signal in pollination interactions across scales provides a new dimension to the story of how past evolution shapes extant pollinator\textendash{}angiosperm interactions.},

Flowering was observed from early April to early November, The number of plant species that concurrently bloomed was nine to 17 from May to September. Themonthly total number of flowering plant species peaked twice in May (34 spp.) and September (33 spp,). From April to August, floweringperiods werestaggered arnong congeneric woody species, e.g., Lindera, Rubus, Hydrangea and Deutzia. A total of 4603 individuals of 889 species in 12 orders of Insecta and 2 orders of Arachnoidea were collected. The most abundant order was Hymenoptera (46 O/o of the total number of individuals), and it was followed by Diptera (30 O/o) and Coleoptera (140/o). The number of species was highest in Diptera (37 O/o), followed by Hymenoptera (32 O/o) and Coleoptera (17 O/o). The numbers of both species and individuals ofall the insect groups peaked in June and September. There were six farnilies, 14 genera and 73 species in Apoidea. Abundant families were Halictidae (36 O/e of individuals), and followed by Bombinae (24 O/o), Xylocopinae (18 O/o), Andrenidae (8 O/o), Hylaeinae (5 O/o) and Nomadinae (5 O/o), Andrenidae and Nomadinae appeared only before August, whereas Halictidae, Xylocopinae, Bombinae and Apinae were active throughout the fiowering season. Cluster analysis separated 49 plant families into five groups: 13 families were mainly visited by Hymenoptera, 17 by Diptera, five by Coleoptera and two by Hemiptera. The other 12 families were visited by various insect groups. Flowers visited by hymenopterans were further separated into plant families mainly visited by Bombinae, Xylocopinae, Halictidae, Apinae, Xylocopinae, Megachilidae, Vespoidea, Ichneumonoidea and others. Flower preference was compared among insect orders and among families, Themostpreferred plant family was Saxifragaceae in Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera,Labiatae in Hemiptera and Umbelliferae in Diptera. Flower preference greatly varied among families in Apoidea. The most preferred plant family was Umbelliferae in Colletidae, Saxifragaceae in Halictidae and Andrenidae, Compositae in Megachilidae, Balsaminaceae in Bombinae, and Rosaceae in Apinae.},

  abstract = {Humans have indirectly influenced species at lower trophic levels by driving losses of apex consumers. Furthermore, humans have indirectly influenced species at higher trophic levels by driving losses of primary producers. Beyond these broad classes of apex consumers and primary producers, it remains challenging to identify minimum subsets of species that are particularly important for maintaining ecosystem structure and functioning. Here we use a novel method at the intersection of control theory and network theory to identify a minimum set of driver node species upon which ecosystem structure strongly depends. Specifically, humans could unintentionally completely restructure ecosystems (i.e., change species abundances from any initial values to any final values, including zero) by altering the abundances of these few critical driver node species. We then quantify the proportion of these driver nodes that are influenced by humans, top predators, and primary producers in several marine food webs. We find that humans could unintentionally completely restructure marine food webs while only directly influencing less than one in four species. Additionally, humans directly influence: (1) most or all of the species necessary to completely restructure each network, (2) more driver nodes than top predators, and at least as many driver nodes as primary producers, and (3) an increasing proportion of driver nodes over time in the Adriatic Sea. We conclude that humans have potentially huge impacts on marine ecosystems while directly influencing only the relatively small subset of species that are currently fished. It may be possible to reduce unintentional and undesirable cascading human influences by decreasing human impacts on driver node species in these and other food webs. ?? 2013 Gesellschaft f??r ??kologie.},

  abstract = {The matching hypothesis in social psychology claims that people are more likely to form a committed relationship with someone equally attractive. Previous works on stochastic models of human mate choice process indicate that patterns supporting the matching hypothesis could occur even when similarity is not the primary consideration in seeking partners. Yet, most if not all of these works concentrate on fully-connected systems. Here we extend the analysis to networks. Our results indicate that the correlation of the couple's attractiveness grows monotonically with the increased average degree and decreased degree diversity of the network. This correlation is lower in sparse networks than in fully-connected systems, because in the former less attractive individuals who find partners are likely to be coupled with ones who are more attractive than them. The chance of failing to be matched decreases exponentially with both the attractiveness and the degree. The matching hypothesis may not hold when the degree-attractiveness correlation is present, which can give rise to negative attractiveness correlation. Finally, we find that the ratio between the number of matched couples and the size of the maximum matching varies non-monotonically with the average degree of the network. Our results reveal the role of network topology in the process of human mate choice and bring insights into future investigations of different matching processes in networks.},

  abstract = {The competitive exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding coexistence. Well-established theories predict the conditions for coexistence in consumer\textendash{}resource interactions. Given that species often compete for commodities offered by mutualists, competitive exclusion theory should also be critical to understanding how mutualisms function. We explicitly apply the competitive exclusion principle to mutualism and derive a rule analogous to Tilman's R* rule for exploitative competition. Coexistence is impossible when competitors compete solely for a shared partner-provided commodity because superior competitors deplete that commodity sufficiently to exclude inferior competitors. We then investigate how competition between two guild members for a partner-provided commodity and a resource external to the mutualism affects competitor coexistence. There are three key results. First, coexistence is possible via partitioning of a partner-provided commodity and another resource. Second, unlike in classic R* Theory, competitive outcomes are influenced both by species' abilities to obtain commodities and their mutualisms with the shared commodity-providing partner, which can indirectly alleviate competitors' commodity limitation. Third, the outcome of competition has important consequences for the commodity-providing partner, which depend on the type of mutualism and the competitive abilities of competing mutualists. This theory provides a novel framework for investigating how competitors for mutualistic commodities coexist in nature.},

  abstract = {Conservation biology should focus more on the importance rather than the rarity of species, although the definition and quantification of importance are not easy. One approach involves measuring the positional importance (e.g. centrality) of species in ecological interaction networks to provide a basis for species ranking. However, there are many centrality indices, each reflecting a particular aspect of positional importance and therefore giving a rank order of species different from those provided by alternative formulations. Thus, there is a strong need for comparing the available indices and for examining their relative merits in network analysis. In this paper, we apply 13 centrality indices to the ``species'' (trophic components) of methodologically comparable trophic flow networks, in order to answer the following questions: (1) What is the disagreement between different indices regarding the rank of a given species in a given network? (2) How is this disagreement in performance influenced by the choice of the network? (3) What is the overall relationship among these indices and, in particular, which are the most similar to degree (the simplest index of all, being equal to the number of links pertaining to a given node)? We compare the 13 indices based on the data of nine networks using metric and rank statistics and multivariate analysis procedures. We conclude that (1) different centrality ranks differ in each network; (2) different webs can be characterized by different relationships between ranks but there is a robust pattern of relationships among the indices, some index pairs behaving very similarly in all networks; and (3) it is the index of closeness centrality which provides a rank most similar to that based on degree.},

Our goal was to quantify the reproductive assurance benefit of autonomous selfing and the stochastic nature of pollinatormediated pollen receipt using three wild populations of the annual species Collinsia verna (Scrophulariaceae) over three years. The timing of autonomous self-pollination in C. verna ranges from competing to delayed, with more than half of the autonomous pollen arriving late in floral life. Floral density, identity of insect floral visitors, and visitation rate varied within and among years, with significant variation in pollinator community between years within populations. Pollinator failure reduced fruit set within and among populations across years. However, reproductive assurance selfing increased fruit set on average by 8\% overall and up to 30\% in one population. Despite this fitness benefit, fruit set (ϭ⌺fruits/⌺flowers) estimated in pollinator-exclusion cages was significantly less than the fruit set in paired open-pollinated plots. In a series of experiments, we found no difference in fruit set from self- vs. outcross pollen, ruling out early inbreeding depression. However, flowers, handoutcrossed at the same time that autonomous selfing naturally occurs, produced significantly more fruits relative to flowers that received pollen only through autonomous selfing. These results suggest that pollen type (self/outcross) is less important to fruiting success than is the timing or efficiency of autonomous pollination relative to vector-mediated pollination. Our results support the reproductive assurance hypothesis and suggest that autonomous selfing in C. verna is adaptive under variable pollinator conditions. Fruit set results from both pollinator-delivered and autonomous self-pollen, suggesting a ``best of both worlds'' scenario, with mixed mating a likely outcome.},

The most abundant order was Diptera (32SO)6o of individuals), followed by Coleoptera (28906o), Hymenoptera (23SO)6e), Hemiptera (1 1 906o), Lepidoptera (4SO)6o). The bee fauna was composed of six families, 13 genera and 26 species, and characterized by dominance of small bees (e,g., Hylaeus, Lasioglossum and Andrena), large carpenter bees (Xylocopa) and long-tongued anthophorine bees (Tetralonia and Amegt'lla), and by absence of Bombus. The bee community contrasted with both the honeybee/stingless bee-dominated community in the Asian Tropics and the bumblebee-dominated community at temperate habitats. The rarity of social-bees is thought to result from seasonal and annual/supra-annual variability in floral resource on the islands. I inferred the pollinators of each plant species by examining flower-visitor communities, visitor behavior, pollen attachment on visitor's body and floral morphology. Among 104 plant species examined, the most dominant pollination type was melittophily (61\%), followed by myiophily (13906), unspecialized entomophily (9.6SO)6o), anemophily (6.7906), butterfly/hawkmoth-pollination (6.7SO)6) and cantharophily (2.9\%o). Among melittophilous species, small-bee-pollinated species (370/o) were most dominant, followed by XylocoPa-(21SO\vphantom\{\}6o), Tetralonia-(17906), megachilid-(9.5SO)6), Amegilla-(7.9SO)6) and Colletes /APis-(6.39(of) and wasp-pollinated (1.6 9(of) species. The high proportions of those plants pollinated by long-tongued solitary bees (55.4SO\vphantom\{\}6) contrasted with the high proportions of bumblebee-po]linated flowers on the mainland of Japan.},

  abstract = {In pollination mutualisms, new resource patches are constantly being created as new flowering species come into bloom. These patch dynamics can have effects on the organization of multispecies pollination guilds, depending on the temporal and spatial variation of floral resources. The goal of this work was to investigate the temporal dynamics of the flower use by a hummingbird community in a highland temperate forest in central Mexico. The system was studied in terms of the seasonal changes in (1) specific composition and abundance of hummingbirds and their plants, (2) use of floral resources, and (3) nectar characteristics of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Eight plant species were visited by hummingbirds. These species differed in nectar and sugar characteristics and flowering intensity throughout the year. The highest floral abundance was recorded from May to October. Three plant species showed blooming peaks in this period; these species, Salvia elegans, Bouvardia ternifolia, and Penstemon roseus, were the most abundant and most visited flowering species over the year. Eight species of hummingbirds were recorded: two resident hummingbirds, three altitudinal migrants, and three winter visitors. Hummingbirds showed seasonal preferences and changes in foraging behaviour with respect to visitation rates and the use of floral resources among habitats. This work suggests that the availability and quality of resources can explain the temporal and spatial composition of the hummingbird community on a local scale.},

Field work was undertaken during 12 expeditions on a monthly basis between June, 2007 and May, 2008. Five species of hummingbirds were recorded visiting flowers in the community studied. Three were considered residents: Chlorostilbon lucidus (Shaw, 1812), Eupetomena macroura (Gmelin, 1788), and Heliomaster squamosus (Temminck, 1823). Hummingbirds visited 31 species of plants, of which only five presented attributes related to ornithophily. C. lucidus visited 29 plant species, including all ornithophilous species, and it was the most aggressive, defending territories. Among hummingbirds, C. lucidus may be considered the principal pollinator. Hummingbirds may also be acting as pollen vectors for some of the plant species not identified as ornithophilous. The hummingbird guilds varied among the plant species used as floral resources, as well as in their frequency of visits. Differences in plant species abundance, hummingbird preference, competitive exclusion or flowering seasonality are factors likely to influence those variations.},

  abstract = {Food webs typically quantify interactions between species, whereas evolution operates through the success of alleles within populations of a single species. To bridge this gap, we quantify genotypic interaction networks among individuals of a single specialized parasitoid species and its obligate to cyclically parthenogenetic aphid host along a climatic gradient. As a case study for the kinds of questions genotype food webs could be used to answer, we show that genetically similar parasitoids became more likely to attack genetically similar hosts in warmer sites (i.e. there was network-wide congruence between the within-species shared allelic distance of the parasitoid and that of its host). Narrowing of host-genotype-niche breadth by parasitoids could reduce resilience of the network to changes in host genetic structure or invasion by novel host genotypes and inhibit biological control. Thus, our approach can be easily used to detect changes to sub-species-level food webs, which may have important ecological and evolutionary implications, such as promoting host-race specialization or the accelerated loss of functional diversity following extinctions of closely related genotypes.},

Little attention has, however, been paid to the systemic response of mutualistic communities to global environmental change. Using a modelling approach and merging network theory with theory on critical transitions, we show that the scale and nature of critical transitions is likely to be influenced by the architecture of mutualistic networks. Specifically, we show that pollinator populations may collapse suddenly once drivers of pollinator decline reach a critical point. A high connectance and/or nestedness of the mutualistic network increases the capacity of pollinator populations to persist under harsh conditions. However, once a tipping point is reached, pollinator populations collapse simultaneously. Recovering from this single community-wide collapse requires a relatively large improvement of conditions. These findings may have large implications for our view on the sustainability of pollinator communities and the services they provide.},

Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

Although the simultaneous measurement of all internal variables, like all metabolite concentrations in a cell, offers a complete description of a system's state, in practice experimental access is limited to only a subset of variables, or sensors. A system is called observable if we can reconstruct the system's complete internal state from its outputs. Here, we adopt a graphical approach derived from the dynamical laws that govern a system to determine the sensors that are necessary to reconstruct the full internal state of a complex system. We apply this approach to biochemical reaction systems, finding that the identified sensors are not only necessary but also sufficient for observability. The developed approach can also identify the optimal sensors for target or partial observability, helping us reconstruct selected state variables from appropriately chosen outputs, a prerequisite for optimal biomarker design. Given the fundamental role observability plays in complex systems, these results offer avenues to systematically explore the dynamics of a wide range of natural, technological and socioeconomic systems.},

Visitation and pollen transport networks were constructed to compare replicated I. glandulifera invaded and I. glandulifera removal plots. Invaded plots had significantly higher visitor species richness, visitor abundance and flower visitation. However, the pollen transport networks were dominated by alien pollen grains in the invaded plots and consequently higher visitation may not translate in facilitation for pollination. The more generalized insects were more likely to visit the alien plant, and Hymenoptera and Hemiptera were more likely to visit the alien than Coleoptera. Our data indicate that generalized native pollinators can provide a pathway of integration for alien plants into native visitation systems.},

The ratio of pollinators to plant species was 1.5, which is lower than in other Arctic pollination networks. This might be a double-island effect as Uummannaq is a small island next to Greenland. Connectance was 14.3\%, and linkage level of pollinator and plant species averaged 2.4 and 3.7 species links, respectively. The characteristic path length and average clustering coefficient of the 1-mode networks were 1.4 and 0.83, respectively, for the pollinator species and 1.3 and 0.79, respectively, for the plant species. For both pollinator species and plant species, the tail of the degree distribution had the best fit to an exponential model, indicating that the most connected species was constrained in their linking. However, the extremely short path length and high clustering indicated that the networks had smallworld behavior, meaning that any disturbance is spread very fast to the entire network and that the networks are error tolerant but vulnerable to attack on the most linked species.},

Both the quantity (number of conspecific pollen grains deposited on stigmas) and quality (proportion of heterospecific pollen grains deposited on stigmas) of the pollination service was estimated for three to nine entomophilous plants in each landscape fragment.

Here, plant\textendash{}floral visitor networks from fragments of grassland restored by agricultural activities discontinued over a long time were compared with networks from agriculturalized fragments nearby. The hypothesis evaluated was that land use intensification changes the structure of the original networks by modifying species richness and the network degree of specialization. The study was carried out at three sites located over a 700 km transect across the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa, Argentina. At each site, four fragments were selected (two restored and two agricultural). Five monthly samplings were taken between November and March along three consecutive years. Entomophilous plants and their floral visitors were identified and all plant\textendash{}floral visitor interactions were recorded. With these data, richness of plants and visitors were calculated, interaction networks were constructed and the degree of specialization was calculated for each network. Land use intensification caused changes in the community composition and degree of specialization. When cropping was the predominant farming enterprise, richness of floral visitors and plants decreased as compared to restored fragments. When cattle production was the predominant land use, richness of floral visitors remained stable. However, at one of the sites plants richness was 48\% higher in the grazed fragments than in those restored. In the agricultural fragments, the abundance of units of floral attraction due to exotic plants increased, but the visitation rates were the same as in the restored fragments. The networks in the agricultural fragments were more generalist than in restored fragments, in agreement with previous studies on the effect of land use intensification on natural systems.},

  abstract = {Agricultural land management modifies ecosystem structure and functioning in natural landscapes. Pollinators are a key functional group that may suffer from such intensification. Here we evaluate how agricultural land management influences the diversity of pollen transported by pollinators and the pollination niche overlap among plants. We described pollen transport networks (which allow assessing the contribution of pollinators to the flow of pollen among plants) in agricultural and restored fragments in three sites representative of the pampas region of Argentina. We analyzed diversity of pollen transported by pollinators and the pollination niche overlap among plants in both types of fragments with general and generalized linear mixed models. The agricultural fragments were associated to increased diversity of transported pollen and pollination niche overlap among plants. Greater pollination niche overlap in agricultural fragments was associated with increased abundance of exotic plants. Our results indicate that agricultural intensification has significantly increased the diversity of pollen and the pollination niche overlap in natural communities by promoting exotic plants and generalized plantpollinator interactions. Strategies to encourage improvements in the quality of pollination in agroecosystems could range from controlling the levels of exotic species to mechanisms that promote increased diversity of native plants.},

@article{martin_gonzalez_centrality_2010,
  abstract = {Studies of complex networks show that nodes with high centrality scores are important to network structure and stability. Following this rationale, centrality measures can be used to (i) identify keystone species in ecological networks, a major issue in community ecology, and (ii) differentiate the keystone species concept, e.g. species may play a key role in a network for different topological reasons. In 34 pollination communities we examine the relationship between the generalization level of species (ND) and two complementary centrality indices: closeness (CC) and betweenness centrality (BC). CC measures the proximity of a species to all other species in the community, while BC describes the importance of a species as a connector. Most networks had a linear ND\textendash{}CC relationship with a minimum CC value of 0.41. Hence, species were close to each and will be likely to be rapidly affected by disturbances. Contrarily, in most networks, the ND\textendash{}BC relationships were power-law distributed with exponents larger than one. Only 59\% of the species were connectors (BC {$>$} 0). In particular, there was a connector threshold value of ND = 0.46. Species above this threshold represent \$40\%, almost all of which were connectors. These results indicate that in pollination systems the most generalized species are usually network keystone species, playing at least two roles: (i) interact closely with most other species (high CC) and (ii) connect otherwise unconnected subnetworks (high BC). We discuss the implications of centrality measures to community-based conservation ecology.},

  abstract = {Complex networks of species interactions might be determined by species traits but also by simple chance meetings governed by species abundances. Although the idea that species traits structure mutualistic networks is appealing, most studies have found abundance to be a major structuring mechanism underlying interaction frequencies. With a well-resolved plant\textendash{}hummingbird interaction network from the Neotropical savanna in Brazil, we asked whether species morphology, phenology, nectar availability and habitat occupancy and/or abundance best predicted the frequency of interactions. For this, we constructed interaction probability matrices and compared them to the observed plant-hummingbird matrix through a likelihood approach. Furthermore, a recently proposed modularity algorithm for weighted bipartite networks was employed to evaluate whether these factors also scale-up to the formation of modules in the network. Interaction frequencies were best predicted by species morphology, phenology and habitat occupancy, while species abundances and nectar availability performed poorly. The plant\textendash{}hummingbird network was modular, and modules were associated to morphological specialization and habitat occupancy. Our findings highlight the importance of traits as determinants of interaction frequencies and network structure, corroborating the results of a previous study on a plant\textendash{}hummingbird network from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Thus, we propose that traits matter more in tropical plant\textendash{}hummingbird networks than in less specialized systems. To test the generality of this hypothesis, future research could employ geographic or taxonomic cross-system comparisons contrasting networks with known differences in level of specialization.},

In the low-altitude (montane) habitat, 23 plant species had a total of 126 interactions with 71 taxa of insects and one hummingbird, and at the higher site 21 plants and 45 insect species had 83 interactions. Connectances of the visitor matrices were 7.6 and 8.7, respectively. Diptera and Hymenoptera dominated the visitor assemblages at both sites without change of proportions with altitude, while Lepidoptera significantly increased at the higher site. Flies were more species-rich than expected at the sites' latitude and more constant across altitudes than is usually observed. Lack of a significant decrease with altitude of (1) the frequency of Hymenoptera and (2) the number of interactions per plant were the main differences with a comparable gradient in the Chilean Andes. The proportion of self-compatible species increased with altitude; however, use of phylogenetically-independent contrasts showed that the prevalence of selfers at higher altitudes does not reflect a generalized reaction pattern but results from two speciose families (Asteraceae and Fabaceae) showing more self-compatibility at high altitudes.},

  abstract = {To determine the patterns of occurrence and importance of indirect effects relative to direct effects in natural communities, I analyzed experimentally based studies from 23 rocky intertidal habitats. The vehicle of analysis was the construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or interaction chains, since little information was available on other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response, environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong) interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web species richness. Less expected, when these measures were adjusted to a per species basis, positive relationships with species richness were still observed for all measures but the number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity, each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect, including the seven previously identified types. Many of the 76 additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if the original definitions of these "classic" types were expanded to include interactions having similar effects but differing in the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference competition and inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect, termed "apparent predation" and "indirect defense" were also identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these, keystone predation (35\%) and apparent competition (25\%) were most common and exploitation competition (2.8\%) was least common in these webs.},

@article{moeller_facilitative_2004,
  abstract = {Outcrossing in plants is influenced by the availability of pollinators and compatible mates, both of which may be modified by the population and community context in which plant\textendash{}pollinator interactions occur. Although indirect interactions among plants through shared pollinators are often expected to be competitive, pollinator sharing may be beneficial when plant species jointly attract or maintain populations of pollinators. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that pollinator-sharing congeners facilitate reproduction in a focal taxon, Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana, and that positive interactions are most pronounced in small and sparse populations. Population surveys revealed that C. x. xantiana frequently coexists with pollinator-sharing congeners except at the periphery of its range. Populations varied extensively in size and density, with small populations more likely associated with pollinator-sharing congeners; conversely, populations occurring alone were more likely large. Flowering schedules in Clarkia communities ranged from segregated to aggregated. Although there was not strong evidence of character displacement, modes in flowering time were often staggered among Clarkia species resulting in a protracted flowering season within plant communities. Studies of bee pollinator availability in 17 populations and pollen limitation to reproduction in 39 replicate populations revealed that populations occurring with multiple congeners had high pollinator availability and low pollen limitation of reproduction compared to populations occurring alone. Population size was inversely related to pollen limitation but did not affect pollinator availability, suggesting that Allee effects were caused by mate limitation. Intraspecific interactions were also positive at a fine spatial scale where pollen deposition increased with the density of closely neighboring conspecifics across 11 populations. Overall, inter- and intraspecific interactions through shared pollinators were generally facilitative, suggesting that population viability and the coexistence of ecologically similar Clarkia species may be promoted by positive reproductive interactions.},

  abstract = {Specialization in pollination systems played a central role in angiosperm diversification, yet the evolution of specialization remains poorly understood. Competition through interspecific pollen transfer may select for specialization through costs to male fitness (pollen lost to heterospecific flowers) or female fitness (heterospecific pollen deposited on stigmas). Previous theoretical treatments of pollination focused solely on seed set, thus overlooking male fitness. Here we use individual-based models that explicitly track pollen fates to explore how competition affects the evolution of specialization. Results show that plants specialize on different pollinators when visit rates are high enough to remove most pollen from anthers; this increases male fitness by minimizing pollen loss to foreign flowers. At low visitation, plants generalize, which minimizes pollen left undispersed in anthers. A model variant in which plants can also evolve differences in sex allocation (pollen/ovule production) produces similar patterns of specialization. At low visitation, plants generalize and allocate more to female function. At high visitation, plants specialize and allocate equally to both sexes (in line with sex-allocation theory). This study demonstrates that floral specialization can be driven by selection through male function alone and more generally highlights the importance of community context in the ecology and evolution of pollination systems.},

However, comparing pollinator performance across studies is difficult because of the diversity of concepts and disparate methods in use. Our review of the literature shows many unresolved ambiguities. Two different assessment concepts predominate: the first estimates stigmatic pollen deposition and the underlying pollinator behaviour parameters, while the second estimates the pollinator's contribution to plant reproductive success, for example in terms of seed set. Both concepts include a number of parameters combined in diverse ways and named under a diversity of synonyms and homonyms. However, these concepts are overlapping because pollen deposition success is the most frequently used proxy for assessing the pollinator's contribution to plant reproductive success. We analyse the diverse concepts and methods in the context of a new proposed conceptual framework with a modular approach based on pollen deposition, visit frequency, and contribution to seed set relative to the plant's maximum female reproductive potential. A system of equations is proposed to optimize the balance between idealised theoretical concepts and practical operational methods. Our framework permits comparisons over a range of floral phenotypes, and spatial and temporal scales, because scaling up is based on the same fundamental unit of analysis, the single visit.},

We consider the well-known problem of computing a minimum spanning tree in a given undirected connected graph with n vertices and m edges. The problem has many applications in the area of network design. Assume that we have n computers that should be connected with minimum cost, where costs of a certain amount occur when one computer is connected to another one. The cost for a connection can, for example, be the distance between two considered computers. One needs to make n-1 connections between these computers such that all computers are able to communicate with each other. Considering a graph as a model for a possible computer network, it has n vertices and one searches for the set of edges with minimal cost that makes the graph connected.},

  abstract = {The network control problem has recently attracted an increasing amount of attention, owing to concerns including the avoidance of cascading failures of power-grids and the management of ecological networks. It has been proven that numerical control can be achieved if the number of control inputs exceeds a certain transition point. In the present study, we investigate the effect of degree correlation on the numerical controllability in networks whose topological structures are reconstructed from both real and modeling systems, and we find that the transition point of the number of control inputs depends strongly on the degree correlation in both undirected and directed networks with moderately sparse links. More interestingly, the effect of the degree correlation on the transition point cannot be observed in dense networks for numerical controllability, which contrasts with the corresponding result for structural controllability. In particular, for directed random networks and scale-free networks, the influence of the degree correlation is determined by the types of correlations. Our approach provides an understanding of control problems in complex sparse networks.},

However, to control a system, one must know not only what parts need to be controlled but also why these particular parts need to be controlled. On page 1373 of this issue, Ruths and Ruths (4) put forward an elegant framework that elucidates the origin of control in networks. The framework divides nodes into three categories based on how they affect the flow of control in networks. This approach gives rise to control profiles that the authors use to classify a host of empirical and synthetic networks. The results suggest that networks from different domains but in the same category may be more similar to one another than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Statistical modelling of species presence/absence data in relation to mapped environmental predictors has been widely used to predict distributions of species for use in regional conservation planning. This paper evaluates the extent to which predictive mapping of habitat suitability might be re\textregistered{}ned by modelling relative abundance or density of a species instead of presence/absence. We use data collected at \textregistered{}eld survey sites in north-east New South Wales to develop models predicting the abundance of vascular plant and vertebrate fauna species as a function of regional-scale environmental variables. The predictive accuracy of these models is then evaluated using survey data collected at independent evaluation sites. A number of `direct' abundance modelling techniques were evaluated including generalised linear and generalised additive Poisson regression, and zero-in\textasciimacron{}ated negative binomial regression. We also evaluated the performance of predicted probability of occurrence generated by logistic regression modelling as an `indirect' index of abundance. Both the direct and indirect modelling techniques generally failed to provide consistently reliable predictions of abundance. Reasonably accurate models were produced for only 12 of the 44 species evaluated. A further key \textregistered{}nding was that, for all 12 of these species, predictions from direct abundance models performed no better as a relative index of abundance than predicted probabilities of occurrence generated by logistic regression modelling. Implications of these results for the use of predictive modelling in regional conservation planning are discussed. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Species flowering during the dry season (late December to early April) form three main pollinator groups, namely, butterfly, solitary bee, and hummingbird flowers. The animal vectors present match these three flower syndromes. The daily and seasonal rhythms of flower opening and pollination activity are synchronized. Butterflies and solitary bees, active chiefly in the morning, visit flowers blooming only half a day. The number of seeds per fruit and the pollencarrying capacity of the pollen vector are correlated. Butterflies, carrying few pollen grains, chiefly pollinate flowers with one to four seeds. Solitary bees, carrying many grains, chiefly pollinate flowers with many seeds per flower. These close links between the flowers and their visitors result in a high degree of successful pollination and a high percentage fruit set. A group of species, attracting no visitors, was characterized by a very narrow 'pollination gap,' making self-pollination almost inevitable. Heavy fruiting indicated self-fertility. Heterocorollary in Cordia sebestena, a double keel in Stylosanthes hamata, and several examples of andromonoecy are recorded for the first time. The presence of the adventive honeybee, Apis mellifera, in the association appeared detrimental to the native pollinators when forage was scarce. The whole scrub association appears balanced with a distinctive pattern of floral ecology. This circumstance, in terms of pollinators, is designated a Butterfly-Solitary bee-Hummingbird association.},

Because species are embedded in species-rich systems characterized by multiple interactions, it is often hard to identify which species are really important for ecological processes such as pollination. Here we show that species-rich networks describing plant-pollinator interactions share a property with networks depicting social relationships, the friendship paradox, which allows identifying highly-connected species without detailed information on the whole network of interactions. Numerical simulations support that the identified species are those more likely to affect community structure and ecological dynamics. A sampling protocol taking into account the friendship paradox property could be adapted to field studies, helping in the search for conservation surrogates or to monitor changes in the communities, such as functional extinction or the increase in ecological importance of invasive species. We hypothesize that the friendship paradox is likely to arise in networks describing other types of ecological interactions. Besides being useful for conservation and ecosystem management, the friendship paradox may have relevant implications in other areas of biology as well.},

  abstract = {Changes in the distribution of rainfall and the occurrence of extreme rain events will alter the size and persistence of aquatic ecosystems. Such alterations may affect the structure of local aquatic communities in terms of species composition, and by altering species interactions. In many aquatic ecosystems, leaf litter sustains detrital food webs and could regulate the responses of communities to changes in rainfall. Few empirical studies have focused on how rainfall changes will affect aquatic communities and none have evaluated if basal resource diversity can increase resistance to such rainfall effects. In this study, we used water-\-holding terrestrial bromeliads, a tropical aquatic ecosystem, to test how predicted rainfall changes and litter diversity may affect community composition and trophic interactions. We used structural equation modeling to investigate the combined effects of rainfall changes and litter diversity on trophic interactions. We demonstrated that changes in rainfall disrupted trophic relationships, even though there were only minor direct effects on species abundance, richness, and community composition. Litter diversity was not able to reduce the impact of changes in rainfall on trophic interactions. We suggest that changes in rainfall can alter the way in which species \-interact with each other, decreasing the linkages among trophic groups. Such reductions in biotic interactions under climate change will have critical consequences for the functioning of tropical aquatic ecosystems.},

Covariance modeling is a powerful tool for extracting meaning from multivariate data, and fast algorithms for Gaussian data, such as factor analysis and Gaussian graphical models, are widely available. Our algorithm makes these tools generally available to analysts of discrete data and can combine any likelihood-based covariance modeling method for Gaussian data with any set of discrete marginal distributions. Previously, tools for discrete data were generally specific to one family of distributions or covariance modeling paradigm, or otherwise did not exist. Our algorithm is more flexible than alternate methods, takes advantage of existing fast algorithms for Gaussian data, and simulations suggest that it outperforms competing graphical modeling and factor analysis procedures for count and binomial data. We additionally show that in a Gaussian copula graphical model with discrete margins, conditional independence relationships in the latent Gaussian variables are inherited by the discrete observations. Our method is illustrated with a graphical model and factor analysis on an overdispersed ecological count dataset of species abundances.},

  abstract = {Crop pollination by wild bees is an ecosystem service of enormous value, but it is under increasing threat from agricultural intensification. As with many ecosystem services, the mechanisms, scales, and species through which crop pollination is provided are too poorly understood to inform land-use decisions. I investigated the role of tropical forest remnants as sources of pollinators to surrounding coffee crops in Costa Rica. In 2001 and 2002 I observed bee activity and pollen deposition rates at coffee flowers along distance gradients from two fragments and one narrow riparian strip of forest. Eleven eusocial species were the most common visitors: 10 species of native meliponines and the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera (hereafter Apis). Bee richness, overall visitation rate, and pollen deposition rate were all significantly higher in sites within approximately 100 m of forest fragments than in sites farther away (maximum distance of 1.6 km). Apis visitation rates were constant across the distance gradient, however, and Apis accounted for {$>$}90\% of all floral visits in distant sites. The gradient from the riparian strip showed a similar drop in bee species richness with distance, but visitation rates were uniformly low along the gradient. Throughout the study area, Apis abundances declined sharply from 2001 to 2002, reducing visitation rates by over 50\% in distant sites (where Apis was almost the only pollinator). In near sites, however, overall visitation rates dropped only 9\% because native species almost entirely compensated for the Apis decline. Forest fragments (more so than the riparian strip) thus provided nearby coffee with a diversity of bees that increased both the amount and stability of pollination services by reducing dependence on a single introduced pollinator. Exploring the economic links between forest preservation and coffee cultivation may help align the goals of conservation and agriculture within many regions of global conservation priority.},

@article{saavedra_nested_2016,
  abstract = {The foundational concepts behind the persistence of ecological communities have been based on two ecological properties: dynamical stability and feasibility. The former is typically regarded as the capacity of a community to return to an original equilibrium state after a perturbation in species abundances and is usually linked to the strength of interspecific interactions. The latter is the capacity to sustain positive abundances on all its constituent species and is linked to both interspecific interactions and species demographic characteristics. Over the last 40 years, theoretical research in ecology has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the dynamical stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to feasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence of whether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's need to be stable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative methods and use empirical data to investigate the consequences of species interactions on the dynamical stability and feasibility of mutualistic communities. First, we demonstrate that the more nested the species interactions in a community are, the lower the mutualistic strength that the community can tolerate without losing dynamical stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a community can be reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly nested species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of a seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research Station (northeastern Greenland), a high feasibility is reached through the nested species interactions established between newcomer and resident species. Our findings imply that nested mutualistic communities promote feasibility over stability, which may suggest that the former can be key for community persistence.},

  abstract = {Island biogeography theory predicts that species richness increases with habitat area and declines with isolation. We expand this framework to address changes in the number of links and species in pollination webs from 12 isolated hills, ranging in area from tens to thousands of hectares, immersed in the agriculture matrix of the Argentine Pampas. We also studied whether total interaction frequency is partitioned more evenly among individual links in richer webs. Our results reveal a direct effect of area on the number of links and species present in each pollination web. However, link richness increased twofold faster than species richness with area. These area effects were not confounded by sampling effort or correlated incidence of exotic species, despite widespread habitat disturbance. Habitat proximity, an inverse measure of isolation, had a marginally significant influence on link but not on species richness. Increased link number was associated with decreasing dominance by any particular interaction and increasing interaction evenness. Despite the strong area effect, a rich pollination web sampled from a small, protected sierra suggests that simple conservation measures, such as reduced grazing and fire suppression, may effectively preserve much local interaction diversity.},

  abstract = {Abstract: We present a population genetic model that incorporates aspects of pollinator efficiency and abundance to examine the effect of the local plant community on the evolution of floral trait specialization. Our model predicts that plant species evolve to be pollinator specialists on the most effective and common pollinators when their abundance is low relative to other plant species in the community (i.e., conspecific pollen is relatively rare) and evolve to be pollinator generalists when they are numerically dominant (i.e., conspecific pollen is abundant). Strong flower constancy also favors generalist floral traits. Furthermore, generalist species are predicted to differentiate when there is a concave trade?off in attracting pollinator species with different floral trait preferences. This result implies that populations that evolve toward a generalist strategy may be more prone to speciation. Ours is the first theoretical model to include local species abundance explicitly, despite the fact that it has been previously identified as an important factor in the evolution of plant specialization. Our results add a layer of ecological complexity to previous models of floral evolution and therefore have the potential to improve our power to predict circumstances under which specialized and generalized plant?pollinator interactions should evolve.},

Annualdifferencesin floweringtimes were associated with differences in average temperatures(i.e., early bloomingin a warm, early spring), but cumulative degree-hours or degree-days of air or soil temperatures were not well correlated with flowering times. Other constraints on flowering phenology are discussed, including the predictability of suitable conditions, a proposed "fail-safe" mechanism that may assure flowering beforecanopyclosureeven if temperaturesareabnormallylow, andthe importanceof nontemperature factors in definingsuitableconditions. Floweringtime was not very finely tunedto the temperature regimeand pollinatoractivity; flowers bloomingduringthe floweringpeak often had low seed productionand the fertilizationrate of most species was low.

The profiles thus obtained are obviously related to niche concepts in the Grinnell tradition, and separated from those in Elton{\~O}s tradition. I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches.

  abstract = {Macroecological models for predicting species distributions usually only include abiotic environmental conditions as explanatory variables, despite knowledge from community ecology that all species are linked to other species through biotic interactions. This disconnect is largely due to the different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines: macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions, while community ecologists focus on small extents and fine resolutions. A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species' presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions and their dynamics under environmental change.},

Here Mays random-matrix modelling approach is generalized to realistic large-scale webs of species interactions, be they structured by networks of competition, mutualism or both. Simple relationships are found to govern these otherwise intractable models, and control the parameter ranges for which biological systems are stable and feasible. Our analysis of model and real empirical networks is only achievable upon introducing a simplifying Google-matrix reduction scheme, which in the process, yields a practical ecological eigenvalue stability index. These results provide an understanding on how network topology, especially connectance, influences species stable coexistence. Constraints controlling feasibility (positive equilibrium populations) in these systems, are found more restrictive than those controlling stability, helping explain the enigma of why many classes of feasible ecological models are nearly always stable.},

We studied interspecific pollen transfer (IPT) networks to evaluate quantity and quality effects of pollinator sharing among plant species on three high-Andean communities at 1600, 1800 and 2000 m a.s.l. To estimate the sign of the effects (positive, neutral or negative), the relation between conspecific and heterospecific pollen deposited on stigmas was analysed with GLMMs. Network analyses showed that communities were characterised by the presence of pollen hub-donors and receptors. We inferred that facilitative and neutral pollinator-mediated interactions among plants prevailed over competition. Thus, the benefits from pollinator sharing seem to outweigh the costs (i.e. heterospecific deposition and conspecific pollen loss). The largest proportion of facilitated species was found at the highest elevation community, suggesting that under unfavourable conditions for the pollination service and at lower plant densities facilitation can be more common.},

This has prompted calls for the conservation of network structure, but precisely which attributes of webs should be conserved remains unclear. Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring. Despite our growing understanding of the characteristics of food webs that confer stability and function, numerous practical challenges need to be overcome before the goal of conserving species interaction networks can be achieved.},

These changes can be broadly grouped according to three nonexclusive mechanisms: (a) changes in the species composition of the networks (driven by interaction patterns of invaders, nonrandom extinction of species according to their traits, or differences among species in population responses across gradients); (b) changes that alter interaction frequencies via changes in search efficiency (driven by altered habitat structure or metabolic rates) or changes in spatial and temporal overlap; and (c) changes to coevolutionary processes and patterns. Taking spatial and temporal processes into account can further elucidate network variation and improve predictions of network responses to environmental change. Emerging evidence links network structure to ecosystem functioning; however, scaling up to metanetworks or multilayer networks may modify interpretations of network structure, stability, and functioning.},

  abstract = {The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.},

Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per-interaction effect, using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large-scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species-rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I ) and total effect (T ) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per-interaction effect (P ) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta-analysis using data on I, P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong, positive relationship between T and I, in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus, frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction, regardless of their effectiveness on a per-interaction basis.},

  abstract = {Predictions on the consequences of the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and associated climate warming for population dynamics, ecological community structure and ecosystem functioning depend on mechanistic energetic models of temperature effects on populations and their interactions. However, such mechanistic approaches combining warming effects on metabolic (energy loss of organisms) and feeding rates (energy gain by organisms) remain a key, yet elusive, goal. Aiming to fill this void, we studied the metabolic rates and functional responses of three differently sized, predatory ground beetles on one mobile and one more resident prey species across a temperature gradient (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 1C). Synthesizing metabolic and functional-response theory, we develop novel mechanistic predictions how predator\textendash{}prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional responses) should respond to warming. Corroborating prior theory, warming caused strong increases in metabolism and decreases in handling time. Consistent with our novel model, we found increases in predator attack rates on a mobile prey, whereas attack rates on a mostly resident prey remained constant across the temperature gradient. Together, these results provide critically important information that environmental warming generally increases the direct short-term per capita interaction strengths between predators and their prey as described by functional-response models. Nevertheless, the several fold stronger increase in metabolism with warming caused decreases in energetic efficiencies (ratio of per capita feeding rate to metabolic rate) for all predator\textendash{}prey interactions. This implies that warming of natural ecosystems may dampen predator\textendash{}prey oscillations thus stabilizing their dynamics. The severe long-term implications; however, include predator starvation due to energetic inefficiency despite abundant resources.},

Problems arising from the management of biological invasions can be either tame (with simple or obvious solutions) or wicked, where difficulty in appropriately defining the problem can make complete solutions impossible to find. We review four case studies that reflect the main goals in the management of biological invasions \textendash{} prevention, eradication, and impact reduction \textendash{} assessing the drivers and extent of wickedness in each. We find that a disconnect between the perception and reality of how wicked a problem is can profoundly influence the likelihood of successful management. For example, managing species introductions can be wicked, but shifting from species-focused to vector-focused risk management can greatly reduce the complexity, making it a tame problem. The scope and scale of the overall management goal will also dictate the wickedness of the problem and the achievability of management solutions (cf. eradication and ecosystem restoration). Finally, managing species that have both positive and negative impacts requires engagement with all stakeholders and scenario-based planning. Effective management of invasions requires either recognizing unavoidable wickedness, or circumventing it by seeking alternative management perspectives.},

Both the natura1 and semi-natura1 grasslands are inhabited by many grassland-specific plant species, some of which are now endangered in Japan. To understand pollination mutualisms in the grassland ecosystem, we investigated the flowering phenology and anthophilous insect communities on 149 plant species from 49 different plant families, from April to October 2001. In tota1, 1192 individuals from 308 species, 83 families and 10 orders of Insecta were observed on flowers of 101 plant species. The most abundant insect order was Hymenoptera (37.89o of individuals), followed by Diptera (32.59o), Coleoptera (22.79o) and Lepidoptera (6.29o), The proportions of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera were respectively smaller and greater than in forested habitats, suggesting that many anthophilous beetles depend on woody plants during their larval stages and that anthophilous butterflies (especially Nymphalidae) are associated with grassland-specific perennials (especially Viola spp.) in their larval stages. The bee fauna consisted of 54 species, from 1O genera and 6 families; the bee community was characterized by an absence of cavity-nesting Hylaeus and Xylocopa and by the predominance of long-tongued Tetratonia in the early spring. The bumblebee community was characterized by the predominance of a shorthaired Bombus ignitus, uncommon in forested habhats. The dominant pollination syndrome, among 70 plant species for which pollinators svere inferred, was melittophily (829o), followed by myophily (149o), psychophily (1.49o), phalaenophily (I.49o) and anemophily (1.49o). Among the melittophilous species, small-bee-pol]inated species (459o) dominated, followed by Bombus- (369o), Apis- (8.69o), Tetratonia- (6.99o), megachilid- (1.79o) and wasp- (1.79o) pollinated species. These data on community-level plant-pollinator interactions at Mt. Yufu will contribute to the conservation of endangered grassland ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Simultaneously flowering plant species may indirectly interact with each other by influencing the quantity of pollinator visitation and/or the quality of pollen that is transferred. These effects on pollination may depend on how pollinators respond to floral resources at multiple levels. In this study, we demonstrate pollinatormediated negative interactions between two invasive plants, Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans. Using constructed arrays of the two species, alone and in mixture, we quantified pollinator visitation at the patch and individual plant levels and measured seed production. We found that co-occurrence of our species led to a shift in pollinator services at both levels. Greater interference occurred when arrays were small and spacings between neighboring plants were large. A spatially explicit movement model suggests that pollinator foraging behavior, which mediates the interactions between plants, was driven by floral display size rather than species identity per se. Pollinator behavior significantly reduced the proportion of seed set for both species relative to that in single-species arrays. Overall, the dependence of pollinator behavior on patch size, spacing between plants, and patch composition can lead to pollinator-mediated plant interactions that range from facilitative to competitive.},

  abstract = {Advanced techniques of network analysis allow the quantification of the indirect interactions and the topo logical importance of components in ecological interaction networks. In current conservation biology, considering in direct causal effects, identifying keystone species and outlining multispecies approaches begin to be high priority goals. We make an attempt to connect these issues within a network context. Our main interest is to determine the positionally most important set of n nodes in a network, to analyse whether a set of nodes for small n is a subset of another for larger n, and to quantify this nestedness. We apply the KeyPlayer software, a novel tool for network analysis in ecology, introduced originally in mathematical sociology. Topological keystone species complexes are defined, we illustrate the use of this method in a case study and analyse a database of 9 plant-pollinator interaction networks. Our main conclusion is that multispecies approaches may give results very different from single species analyses.},

  abstract = {We study matchings on sparse random graphs by means of the cavity method. We first show how the method reproduces several known results about maximum and perfect matchings in regular and Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Our main new result is the computation of the entropy, i.e. the leading order of the logarithm of the number of solutions, of matchings with a given size. We derive both an algorithm to compute this entropy for an arbitrary graph with a girth that diverges in the large size limit, and an analytic result for the entropy in regular and Erdos-Renyi random graph ensembles.},

  abstract = {Minimum driver node sets (MDSs) play an important role in studying the structural controllability of complex networks. Recent research has shown that MDSs tend to avoid high-degree nodes. However, this observation is based on the analysis of a small number of MDSs, because enumerating all of the MDSs of a network is a \#P problem. Therefore, past research has not been sufficient to arrive at a convincing conclusion. In this paper, first, we propose a preferential matching algorithm to find MDSs that have a specific degree property. Then, we show that the MDSs obtained by preferential matching can be composed of high- and medium-degree nodes. Moreover, the experimental results also show that the average degree of the MDSs of some networks tends to be greater than that of the overall network, even when the MDSs are obtained using previous research method. Further analysis shows that whether the driver nodes tend to be high-degree nodes or not is closely related to the edge direction of the network.},
