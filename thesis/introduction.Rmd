    Los animales todos, en suma, no pueden pasarse sin alimento.
    El animal cazador no puede tampoco escapar de ser, a su vez, cazado.
    Todo animal debil devora al que es mas debil que el. Todo animal fuerte, no puede librarse de ser devorado por otro animal mas fuerte que el. Y en esto son exactamente igual los hombres, unos respecto de otros, aunque no lieguen a los mismos extremos. Dios, en suma, ha puesto a unos seres como causa de la vida de otros, y reciprocamente a estos como causa de la muerte de aquellos.  } \\ \medskip

From food and freshwater production to recereationa and carbon sequestration, ecosystems provide a wide range of services of considerable value to humans. 
Unfortunately, the ability of ecosystems to provide these services is currently threatened by global change. 
Climate change and invasive alien species in particular are one of the largest causes of ecosystem degradation. 
A necessary step to anticipate, prevent, and reverse ecosystem degradation is to understand the factors that determine their response to disturbancees. 

A substantial amount of recent research indicates that the way ecosystems respond to disturbances is largely determined by the network of interactions formed by the species that inhabit it. 
This is so, because this network, which connects all organisms in an ecological community, underpins ecosystem functioning and structure, and, therefore, can modulate the resilience of ecosystem services to disturbances. 
However, 


, this is that ecosystem structure is

Ecological nStructure of ecological networks determine the function and services.
Therefore I study structure and their interactions

Knowing how networks are assembled and disassembled is important. 
How many species. degree distribution. etc.
